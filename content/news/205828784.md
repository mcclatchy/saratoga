<p>Attorneys for Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens asked Monday that his trial date be moved up to April 3 and that the verdict be determined by the judge instead of a jury.</p><p>Edward Dowd Jr. said the governor's attorneys want the case concluded quickly.</p><p>"The governor is innocent and he is entitled to have his case heard," Dowd said.</p><p>The trial currently is scheduled to begin May 14.</p><p>Moving the trial date to April 3 would mean legal proceedings would start before a Missouri House committee investigating the governor finishes its work and makes its findings public. </p><p>The committee's final report, along with transcripts of its proceedings, are to be released by April 8, and the committee's chairman — Republican Rep. Jay Barnes — said it is on pace to meet that deadline. </p><p>The legislative investigation is the first step towards possible impeachment proceedings. </p><p>The governor's attorneys also asked Monday for a bench trial rather than a jury trial.</p><p>In some states a defendant can’t waive a jury trial without the permission of the prosecutor, but in Missouri the judge can grant the waiver.</p><p>St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner will object to the earlier trial date, her office said.</p><p>"It’s already on an accelerated pace and this request is just designed to harass the prosecution," said Gardner's spokeswoman, Susan Ryan.</p><p>Gardner also will object to the governor's request for a bench trial.</p><p>"The circuit attorney believes the citizens of St. Louis deserve to hear the evidence and make a decision in this case," Ryan said.</p><p>Greitens has been <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article201629499.html" target="_blank">charged with invasion of privacy</a> stemming from a 2015 affair. The felony charge alleges Greitens knowingly photographed the woman with whom he had the affair and transmitted the image “in a manner that allowed access to that image via a computer.”</p><p>Last week, both prosecuting attorneys and lawyers for the governor’s former lover expressed opposition to allowing cameras in the courtroom during the trial.</p><p>St. Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison has not announced a decision on whether cameras will be allowed in the courtroom.</p><p>Defense attorneys also filed a motion to dismiss the state’s special prosecuting attorney, Ronald S. Sullivan, arguing his appointment is illegal because special prosecutors may only be appointed by judge when the elected prosecutor has a conflict of interest. The motion also notes that Sullivan has no prosecutorial experience and was hired specifically for the Greitens case. </p><p>In addition to being a professor of law at Harvard University, Sullivan is a private defense lawyer whose previous clients include the family of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old fatally who was shot in 2014 by a policeman in Ferguson and whose death set off months of protests in and around the St. Louis suburb.</p><p>Ryan dismissed the complaint as “irrelevant,” citing historical rulings where similar cases were allowed to move forward. <br /></p><p>Previous circuit attorneys — including Jennifer Joyce, Dee Joyce-Hayes and George Peach — all used special assistant circuit attorneys, she said.</p><p>"The law’s clear that Kim Gardner is able to swear in up to seven special prosecutors," Ryan said.</p><p><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article202698314.ece" id="_93189fa2-2b6f-4741-ba55-0aa7b24027b0">DEEP BACKGROUND(102): After Greitens indictment, Missouri politics are in uncharted territory</a><br /></p><div class="ng_endnote_contact">The Star's Lindsay Wise and Jason Hancock contributed to this article.</div>

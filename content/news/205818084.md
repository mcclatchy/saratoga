<p>A lot of cats don't even live 14 years. </p><p>But that's how long a Florida cat went missing from his owner.</p><p><a href="https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/martin-county/2018/03/16/cat-missing-14-years-reunited-owner-humane-society-treasure-coast/421388002/" target="_self">The TCPalm</a> reports that an orange cat named T2 (for Thomas Jr.) who ran away after a hurricane in 2004 has just this month been reunited with his owner, who had given up hope and moved on with his life.</p><p>"Who would have thought that after 14 years you'd find your lost cat?" said Perry Martin of Fort Pierce.<br /></p><p>Martin had his vet implant an identity microchip between T2's shoulder blades back in 2002. When Hurricane Jeanne hit in 2004, he moved in with a friend. And T2 ran away.</p><p>That's the way it goes with cats.<br /></p><p>But on March 9, Martin got a call from the Humane Society. A county animal control officer had picked up T2 as a stray and brought him to the shelter, where the chip was scanned and his identity learned.</p><p>"It was too crazy to believe," Martin said.</p><p>It is not clear whether T2 found a second home or lived a wild life all these years. He's now 18 years old.</p><p>"I will make sure he's comfortable for the rest of his time here," Martin said.<br /></p>

<p>Historian Fred Whitehead was taking some friends to see the John Brown Memorial near the <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article135161774.html" target="_self">Quindaro Townsite ruins</a> of Kansas City, Kansas, on Sunday morning when he discovered the statue of the famous Kansas abolitionist had been vandalized.</p><p>A swastika had been depicted on Brown's forehead in black, and the word "Satan" had been written on his beard. At the base of the statue — which bears the words "Erected to the memory of John Brown by a grateful people" — the word "people" had been crossed out and replaced with the n-word and a phallic symbol.</p><p>"It was a sickening sight," said Whitehead. "There are racists and Nazis still around. It suggests that John Brown provokes a visceral reaction in these people. "</p><p>Whitehead said he made a police report. Kansas City, Kan. police spokesperson Thomas Tomasic said officers were dispatched to the statue at 27th Street and Sewell Avenue shortly after 2 p.m. </p><p>He said the markings were made with black marker. </p><p>Whitehead said he assumes the vandalism occurred over the weekend, as the statue was not defaced when he visited the Quindaro Townsite last weekend.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nationalheritageareas.us/kansas-citys-quindaro-townsite-ruins-seek-landmark-designation/" target="_self">community of Quindaro</a> was a free-state port for abolitionists and a safe haven for those escaping slavery, as well as a stop on the Underground Railroad. It was also home to Western University, the first African-American university west of the Mississippi River, until the school closed in the 1940s.</p><p>Kansas historian Patrick Sumner, who studied Brown and the Underground Railroad for his master's degree at the University of Kansas, said the $5,000 statue was carved from Italian marble and paid for by the working class and the poor, who gave nickels and dimes to fund the statue before its 1911 dedication. </p><p>It is thought to be the first statue of Brown. </p><p>Sumner was dismayed when he heard from Whitehead, and from a friend in the Police Department, that the statue had been defaced.</p><p>"It’s a very important statue which was put together by the people of Quindaro," Sumner said. "It should be recognized and respected instead of defaced."</p><p><img src="http://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/3p2gbk/picture205787684/binary/john%20brown.jpg" id="_d83cd82d-6b23-4a06-8952-ae3f8f582413" alt="undefined" /></p><p><img src="http://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/u4wp17/picture205800809/binary/BROWN%20ME%2020180318%20KAM%20080F.jpg" id="_2c37c14e-4260-4b62-b55d-12172520c987" alt="undefined" /></p><p><img src="http://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/8mnge2/picture205800814/binary/BROWN%20ME%2020180318%20KAM%20033F.jpg" id="_2fe1fff0-2d39-4379-a1ca-ef232f80be48" alt="undefined" /></p><div class="ng_endnote_contact">Katy Bergen: <a href="tel:816-234-4120">816-234-4120</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/KatyBergen" target="_blank">@KatyBergen</a></div>

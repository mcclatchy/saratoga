<p>Deandrea Vine wouldn’t know what to do in the face of such violence, her mother said, thinking of her 27-year-old daughter’s final moments.</p><p>Vine worked at Walmart and lived her life overcoming learning disabilities and epilepsy while struggling to raise four children, the mother, Kelly Jackson, said.</p><p>In the early morning hours Saturday Vine<a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article215732280.html" target="_blank"> was stabbed to death</a>, falling face-down in the yard out front of the southeast Kansas City home where she lived.</p><p>“She never experienced fighting like that,” Kelly Jackson said. “She wouldn’t be able to know what was happening.”</p><p>A cousin discovered Vine’s body about 4 a.m. Saturday and ran into the house, sending out the grandmother, who screamed over the sight.</p><p><img src="https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/8ur6ea/picture215733165/binary/Vine%20cro_fitted.jpeg" id="_11263844-5000-48a8-aa55-a5430eba0bd7" alt="undefined" /></p><p>The family’s van, which was parked in the driveway, is where Vine may have been attacked, the family said, before she ended up in the front yard.</p><p>Kelly Jackson stood Sunday with her hands on the shoulders of her own mother — Vine’s grandmother — Bernice Jackson, who sat in a chair outside the home, rocking with grief.</p><p>“I keep thinking about her lying there,” Bernice Jackson said. “She never had no fight with anyone for someone to kill her like that.”</p><p>Police are investigating the killing and have not yet released any information about a possible suspect.</p><p>Nothing had come easily for Vine, Kelly Jackson said. The father of Vine’s children killed himself about a year ago. Vine and her four children had been living at the home of her mother and grandmother.</p><p>But through it all, Kelly Jackson said, her daughter “had that righteousness feeling.”</p><p>On hard mornings, Vine would look at herself in the mirror and shake her head as if to loosen her hair and free herself of life’s weight.</p><p>“She’d say, ‘I am beautiful still,’” Kelly Jackson said. “She said, ‘I am going to continue going. I’m going to get what I need to be doing.’ That’s that righteousness feeling.”</p><p><img src="https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/5dy6xx/picture215750490/binary/Vine001" id="_f6be7fdf-00c7-43f4-b07f-18db43ca205f" alt="undefined" /></p><p>Vine couldn’t drive because of her medical condition. Between them, her mother and her grandmother got her to and from her job at Walmart. They were proud of her.</p><p>They want anyone who knows about Vine’s killing to help the police. And they want the community to pay attention to the violence in the neighborhood.</p><p>“This is not a good thing to be having in this area,” Kelly Jackson said. “Everyone needs to know about this brutal situation.”</p><p>The children Deandrea Vine leaves behind with her mother and grandmother are a 7-year-old daughter, a 5-year-old son, a 3-year-old daughter and a 21-month old son. The family has <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/deandrea-vine" target="_blank">set up a GoFundMe page</a> to help in support of her children and funeral costs.</p><p>Anyone with information is asked to call the <a href="http://kccrimestoppers.com/sitemenu.aspx?ID=452&amp;" target="_self">TIPS Hotline</a> at 816-474-TIPS (8477).</p>

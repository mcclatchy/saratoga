<p>There are a lot of good science podcasts out there, so you can skip the Uninterrupted Road Trippin’ podcast with DJ Montage and Allie Clifton.</p><p>Last year, Kyrie Irving talked about his <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2697993-kyrie-irving-discusses-controversy-surrounding-his-flat-earth-comments" target="_self">flat earth theory on the podcast</a>. This week, former Mizzou star Jordan Clarkson was on the podcast and put forth a theory that is even more bizarre.</p><p>Clarkson and his Cavaliers teammate Larry Nance Jr. were guests on the podcast and the talk turned to DJ Montage and his belief that dinosaurs never existed.</p><p>That led to this exchange:</p><p dir="ltr"><b>Clarkson:</b> I don’t believe in dinosaurs either. Well no, I actually do. I believe that - alright this is gonna get a little crazy, alright. I’m gonna take y’all a little left on this. OK, so y’all know how we got dogs and stuff, right?</p><p dir="ltr"><b>DJ Montage:</b> Right.<br /></p><p><b>Clarkson:</b> So, I think it was bigger people in the world before us, and, like, the dinosaurs (were) they pets.<br /></p><p><b>DJ Montage: </b>On a leash? Like a pet? So how big were these people?<br /></p><p><b>Clarkson:</b> Oh, you look at a dinosaur. They got to be three times bigger than them.<br /></p><p><b>DJ Montage: </b>Where are their bones?<br /></p><p><b>Clarkson: </b>Mm-hm.<br /></p><p>The bones thing is apparently kind of a big deal with DJ Montage, because he later wondered why no dinosaur bones have been discovered in Ohio.</p><p dir="ltr">“I didn’t find a triceratops in Kentucky," DJ Montage said. "They’re all in somewhere in Arizona, they’re all in Jurassic Park."<br /></p><p>Mm-hm, indeed.</p><p>There are plenty of sites where DJ Montage can read up on the reasons why <a href="http://www.mentorpl.org/dinosaurs-in-ohio/" target="_self">Ohio is without dinosaur bones</a>.</p><p>As for Clarkson's hot take on dinosaurs being pets, maybe he meant this:</p><p><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article205974509.ece" id="_2528b626-36d0-4663-b633-7dd14d78fca8">embed dino</a></p>

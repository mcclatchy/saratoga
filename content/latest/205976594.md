<p>While Syracuse was celebrating its upset win Sunday over Michigan State in the NCAA Tournament, the Orange turned its attention to it next game, which will be played in Omaha.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/NicoleAuerbach/status/975485687138017280" target="_self">Nicole Auerbach of the Athletic</a> tweeted what she overheard in the Syracuse locker room: "“Nebraska is like Missouri. Flat and farms.”</p><p>I'm not sure why Missouri was used as a comparison, but whatever the case, the comment didn't sit well with the fine folks in the Cornhusker state.</p><p>Chris Peters of the Omaha World-Herald took a closer look at the number of farms in Nebraska and New York state. Ditto for the flatness.</p><p>As Peters wrote i<a href="http://www.omaha.com/sports/people-who-live-in-itty-bitty-syracuse-n-y-shouldn/article_3b5f9cbb-fe81-5817-9f44-11df7bbb75be.html" target="_self">n the article with the headline</a>, "People who live in itty-bitty Syracuse (N.Y.) shouldn't throw shade on Nebraska:"</p><p dir="ltr">"When the Syracuse Orange come to Omaha, they'll arrive in a city three times the size of their own where people make nearly twice as much money a year on average.</p><p dir="ltr">"And the zoo. Don't even get us started on the zoo.</p><p dir="ltr">"So yeah, Nebraska's a little flat. It has its fair share of farms. But man, look who's calling the kettle black. Or the orange orange.</p><p dir="ltr">"Just take note of this, small-timers. When you park your bus for the big game in the big city on Friday night, this isn't little Syracuse (population 143,378).</p><p dir="ltr">"Here in a real city, the parking meters run till 9."</p><p dir="ltr">On Twitter, others offered their thoughts on the comment:</p><p><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article205977839.ece" id="_06c09879-9c49-4b48-821d-55b2f6dd07de">EMBED Omaha1</a></p><p><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article205978004.ece" id="_8824fafe-d7f4-49f6-a516-568201868fa1">EMBED Omaha2</a></p><p><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article205978119.ece" id="_dfb6d438-390a-4db8-8fa3-8dfd91bc1c41">EMBED Omaha3</a></p><p><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article205978284.ece" id="_619e7bd8-9479-4b9f-87f7-519551d6d7f3">EMBED Omaha4</a></p><p><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article205978339.ece" id="_9f1468aa-3e92-4d55-831c-1e0a97dad0af">EMBED Omaha5</a></p><p><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article205978469.ece" id="_01d955f1-50fd-4436-a888-0cf9090a8ad9">EMBED Omaha6</a></p><p><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article205978734.ece" id="_4740e473-ed41-41a6-9d98-41cea9183b4b">EMBED Omaha7</a></p><p><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article205979034.ece" id="_31820220-8a2b-4359-963f-c9fe4dbc430d">EMBED Omaha8</a></p>

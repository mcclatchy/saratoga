<p>Less than five months after opening in the <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/biz-columns-blogs/cityscape/article183463461.html" target="_self">West Bottoms, Blade &amp; Timber</a> is already drawing customers from across the metro. </p><p>So owners Matt Baysinger and Ryan Henrich have signed a lease for a second location and are looking for a third. </p><p>Blade &amp; Timber is scheduled to open May 1 in Town Center Plaza, 5203 W. 117th St., Leawood, in the former Mark's Rugs space. Town Center Plaza confirmed the opening.</p><p><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article205922834.ece" id="_afc74e77-387f-4c4e-bdb3-9885350aad47">new blade &amp; timber map leawood</a></p><p>At Blade &amp; Timber, customers enter a walled lane and pick up an ax (gripping the handle thumb over thumb like a golf club). They then lift it above their head and lean in with their body as they aim for a target about 12 to 15 feet away. </p><p>Just like in darts, they want to make a bull's-eye.</p><p>"It is something that people think they could never do and in an hour, with some training, they can become proficient," Henrich said.</p><p>Fees vary by time and date, but $20 an hour for one player. Discounts are available for more players and longer play times. It has a sports bar atmosphere with lounge areas and multiple TVs. The West Bottoms location will soon serve beer, and the Leawood location will serve beer when it opens.<br /></p><p>The owners are looking at about a dozen cities for expansion, including Honolulu, where they operate <a href="https://breakoutwaikiki.com/" target="_self">Breakout Waikiki,</a> one of their six Breakout escape room centers. But they wanted to make sure to have Kansas City covered first with enough Blade &amp; Timber locations.</p><p>"The response has been overwhelming. We are busy most nights and packed Friday, Saturday, Sunday," Henrich said.</p>

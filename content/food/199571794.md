<p>With bitter cold temperatures this weekend, brothers Cameron and Tyler McNie may have picked the best time to offer Belton a touch of the balmy islands.</p><p>Their Hawaiian Bros. Island Grill opened at 1112 E. North Ave. (in a former Long John Silver’s) and was so popular it sold out of the No. 5 plate, the Luau Pig, by late afternoon Saturday.</p><div class="ng_mm_link2"><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">It is 20 degrees in Belton but customers at the new Hawaiian Bros Island Grill are enjoying a &amp;#39;luau&amp;#39; <a href="https://t.co/wUfuUFd0Le">pic.twitter.com/wUfuUFd0Le</a></p>&amp;mdash; Joyce Smith (@JoyceKC) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoyceKC/status/962452507862683649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2018</a></blockquote>

</div></div><p>Still, customers had a choice of the No. 1 Huli Huli chicken plate (boneless skinless chicken marinated overnight in the house-made sweet teriyaki sauce and grilled throughout the day); the No. 2 Molokai chicken (with a sweet and spicy kick that can be turned up even hotter); the No. 3 Honolulu chicken (its teriyaki sauce is infused with fresh garlic, green onions and sesame); the No. 4 grilled vegetables (sugar snap peas, carrots, broccoli, onions, mushrooms, squash and red bell peppers grilled to order in teriyaki sauce); and the No. 6 Pacific Island salad (with Huli Huli chicken, mandarin oranges, fresh mushrooms, green onions, a pinch of cilantro and Chow Mein noodles on romaine).</p><p>Hawaiian Bros. specializes in the plate lunches which come with two scoops of white rice, one scoop of macaroni salad and one portion of meat (or grilled vegetables) in the classic size for $8.50. It also has small plates for $6.50 and large plates for $11.50, as well as sandwiches and sides including pineapple.</p><p>The brothers sell their teriyaki sauce (gluten-free) in bottles for $10 and also will cater. The drive-through will open in about a week and the restaurant also will start taking online orders at that time.</p><p>The McNie brothers helped grow their parents’ Hawaiian Time from one quick-service operation in Oregon to nine locations in the state, <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/biz-columns-blogs/cityscape/article191121799.html" target="_blank" title="">before working on the Hawaiian Bros. concept</a>. They are looking at Lawrence locations for a scheduled summer opening. They may open a third location by the end of the year and are looking at sites in Lee’s Summit, Liberty, the Northland and Overland Park.</p><div class="ng_mm_link1"><div class="videowrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3108.7990945107613!2d-94.51802698514964!3d38.814156459452555!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x87c0db86d3885427%3A0xe487971362a7614d!2s1112+E+North+Ave%2C+Belton%2C+MO+64012!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1518363043118" style="border:0" width="400">&nbsp;</iframe>

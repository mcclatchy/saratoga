<p>New Mexico Hatch chile peppers flavor the delicious food that Gina Kuwata serves. She and her husband, Seiji, have three sons and live in Lee’s Summit. Twenty-five years ago, Gina, a stress management coach, moved from New Mexico to the Kansas City area, but she still frequently prepares and serves New Mexican cuisine.</p><p><span class="ng_intro_bold_italic">Q: You mention New Mexican cuisine. What is that?</span></p><p><span class="ng_page_topic_leadin">A: It is different from Mexican and Tex-Mex foods as it relies more heavily on New Mexico peppers, <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/chow-town/article325039/It%E2%80%99s-Hatch-Pepper-season.html" target="_blank" title="">especially the Hatch chile</a>.</span> </p><p><span class="ng_intro_bold_italic">Q: What are Hatch chile peppers and how do you use them?</span> </p><p><span class="ng_page_topic_leadin">A: The Hatch chile is a specific green chile from the Hatch Valley in southern New Mexico. While similar in appearance to other green chile peppers, such as the Anaheim or Pueblo chile pepper, their flavor and skin are distinctive, and these characteristics make them a favorite. They are in season and available fresh in the late summer and early fall, or they can be purchased in jars of salsa year-round.</span> </p><p>The fresh peppers are first fire-roasted. When in season, some local grocery stores will roast them for you or you can roast your own. Once roasted, remove the skin, stem, membranes and seeds and chop, using a food processor. Once chopped, they can be frozen for use in recipes year-round.</p><p>When Hatch chile peppers are not available fresh, you can purchase jars of Hatch Valley salsa from grocery stores such as Trader Joe’s or Sprouts. </p><p><img id="_1391229a-4176-4dd2-8ee3-49cbb31b5722" src="http://www.kansascity.com/living/food-drink/come-into-my-kitchen/m366k9/picture205504239/binary/0321%20cimk%20kuwata%2003022018%20s%20(3)" alt="0321 cimk kuwata 03022018 s (3)" /></p> <p><span class="ng_intro_bold_italic">Q: The queso recipe you are sharing tastes different from typical queso. What makes it so flavorful?</span></p><p><span class="ng_page_topic_leadin">A: The Hatch chile peppers give a depth of flavor that is unique. Also, fire-roasting both the chile peppers and the tomatoes adds to the flavor. I always freshly shred or grate the cheese, instead of buying shredded cheese in packages, as it tastes better.</span></p><p><span class="ng_intro_bold_italic">Q: Do you serve chile peppers often?</span></p><p><span class="ng_page_topic_leadin">A: Yes! If you are from New Mexico, this is “our soul food.”</span></p><p> I serve the chile peppers as sauce on eggs, as a flavor boost in soups, with avocados and in dishes such as the queso and Frito Pie. The chile peppers are packed with nutrition, especially vitamin C, so we eat some form of them almost daily. </p><p><span class="ng_intro_bold_italic">Q: You mention entertaining and your kitchen is filled with beautiful, distinctive dishes. Do you enjoy entertaining?</span></p><p><span class="ng_page_topic_leadin">A: I love to entertain, and when my guests leave, I hope they leave with “happy hearts and happy bellies.” I use artisan-inspired dishes, especially in colors of the Southwest, and use <a href="http://www.nambe.com/" target="_blank" title="">Nambé silver</a>, which are beautiful pieces from Santa Fe.</span> </p><p>When serving the New Mexico Frito Pie, I typically make a buffet, so guests ladle beans, chile sauce and toppings, as they desire, into bowls. I serve the queso in a slow cooker to keep it warm.</p><div class="ng_endnote_contact"><p>Roxanne Wyss and Kathy Moore are cookbook authors and food consultants that make up The Electrified Cooks.

Place the beans in a large bowl and cover with cold water. (Use about twice the volume of water as beans.) Allow beans to soak overnight. (For a quicker preparation, place the beans in a large saucepan and cover by 3 inches of water. Heat until boiling, reduce heat, cover and boil gently 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow to stand 90 minutes.)</p><p>Drain the beans and discard the water. Place the beans in a saucepan and add fresh water to cover by about 2 inches. Heat until boiling, reduce to a simmer, partially cover and allow to cook 3 to 4 hours or until beans are tender.

Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring often about 20 minutes or until the chile sauce is the consistency of a thick sauce. Season to taste with salt and stir in the browned ground beef. (The sauce will not thicken like a cream-based sauce, but will not be watery.)</p><p>To assemble the pie:</p><p>Layer the beans and the red chile sauce in individual serving bowls. Top with grated cheese, chopped onions and corn chips. </p><p><strong>Tip:</strong></p><p><span class="ng_z_sym_square_bullet">▪&nbsp;</span>New Mexico red chile powder is a specific type of chile powder. Look for brands such as Los Chileros, labeled New Mexico red chile powder, at Whole Foods or other specialty stores. </p><p><span class="ng_z_sym_square_bullet">▪&nbsp;</span>Cooked pinto beans freeze well, so make plenty and freeze for other uses. </p></div>

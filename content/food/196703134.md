<p>Chef Thomas Salamunovich created such a popular burger for the fine-dining Larkspur restaurant in Vail, Colo., that it got its own restaurant.</p><p>Eleven years later there are 14 <a href="http://larkburger.com/" target="_blank" title="">Larkburger</a> locations, including one that had its grand opening on Jan. 25 just south of the Country Club Plaza. The first 50 customers were given free entree cards to use on a return visit and a chance to win 52 Larkburger entree cards (for a free burger, sandwich or salad).</p><p>The 2,200-square-foot restaurant in the 4800 Main Building, at 4800 Main St., Suite 102, will seat 90 people. It has a contemporary design featuring Cypress timber and chairs made from 100 percent recycled material. It also will have a large community table and complimentary Wi-Fi.</p><div class="ng_mm_link1"><div class="videowrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3098.9636120541695!2d-94.59004868464545!3d39.038949079549134!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x87c0efbeade4e361%3A0xa3a66f3ea4449317!2s4800+Main+St+%23102%2C+Kansas+City%2C+MO+64112!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1516909948369" style="border:0" width="400">&nbsp;</iframe>

<p>Thrillist, an online publisher covering food, drink, entertainment and travel news, says fried chicken might be the world’s most versatile food — from breakfast with waffles to dinner and beyond. </p><p>So it has selected the <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/21-best-fried-chicken-in-america" target="_blank" title="">nation’s 31 best fried chicken </a>places. They range from umami-spiced fried chicken in Seattle to the chicken shacks of Nashville to Miami (yes, Miami, including one serving it with spicy Tabasco honey). </p><p>Thrillist narrowed it down to establishments with only a few locations (so <a href="http://gusfriedchicken.com/" target="_blank" title="">Gus’s World Famous Fried Chicken</a> didn’t make the list). But Kansas City’s own <a href="http://www.stroudsnorth.com/" target="_blank" title="">Stroud’s Oak Ridge Manor Restaurant &amp; Bar </a>did. </p><p>Thrillist had this to say about the Northland Stroud’s: <em>“Like us, you’ve always wanted to eat your fried chicken in an 1829 log cabin and farmhouse, Oak Ridge Manor is the place to do it. Since 1933, the good people of north Kansas City have gathered here for their pan-fried chicken. Get the regular dinner, and when you bite into that crunchy, salty, juicy, peppery chicken mess, and grease runs all down your face and YOU JUST DON’T CARE BECAUSE IT’S THAT GOOD, maybe pause for a second and appreciate your surroundings. Or, if you need more famous people to tell you how good it is, they’ve got great quotations lauding their chicken along the bottom of their website. So if you’re wondering if seven-time World Series-winning professional baseball star’ Hank Bauer called it ‘The best darn chicken I ever ate,’ worry no more. He might just be right.”</em></p><p>Jim Hogan and Mike Donegan purchased the Stroud’s location at 85th and Troost in 1977. Donegan became the sole owner in the early 1990s and later moved the restaurant to Fairway. In late 2013, he teamed up with KC Hopps Ltd. to open additional Stroud’s restaurants and KC Hopps also became a partner in the Fairway location. Stroud’s have since opened in Independence, Overland Park and Omaha. However, the Independence and Omaha locations closed.</p><p>Donegan retained ownership of the Northland location at 5410 N.E. Oak Ridge Drive.</p><div class="ng_mm_link1"><div class="videowrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3092.121365658415!2d-94.51513058513745!3d39.19469093697099!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x87c0f8fdab09bbf7%3A0xb15719a0cdedac03!2s5410+NE+Oak+Ridge+Dr%2C+Kansas+City%2C+MO+64119!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1518360302965" style="border:0" width="400">&nbsp;</iframe>

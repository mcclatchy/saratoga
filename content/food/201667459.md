I accepted, because I'm a dedicated journalist.</p><p>Jeremy Danner, Boulevard's ambassador brewer, had an interesting and intelligent description. Mine was simpler: it's a ballpark beer, and even having a sip (or three) on a day icy enough for schools to be cancelled it made me think of warmer weather and baseball. Watch the video above for our awkward non-handshake and Danner's answer when I asked if this was a playoff beer or a rebuilding beer.</p></div></div></div>

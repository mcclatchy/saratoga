Yet millions are being deprived of those blessings — not because of their own failures, but because of the color of their skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The reasons are deeply imbedded in history and tradition and the nature of man.

If you were black, you could travel freely through the South, get a hotel room and buy a hamburger at Krystal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new law ensured that black Americans enjoyed the same rights as white Americans when it came to education, employment and access to stores, restaurants and hotels. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFifty years later, we take it for granted that black Americans are entitled to the same liberties as white Americans. And yet statistics in key areas tell a different story about the distribution of opportunity. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe black-white wealth gap is stark and growing: Nationally, white families on average have six times as much wealth as black families.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnemployment rates for blacks are consistently double those of whites. In May, 11.5 percent compared to 5.4 percent. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Missouri, a report last month showed black drivers are 66 percent more likely to be pulled over than white drivers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe disparities cannot be simply explained by differences in ability or effort.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut real progress has been made as well.

She is smiling, because she always smiles, but her hand creeps across a cushion toward Micah’s. “It always happened when we were dating. When we got married, I thought, ‘Oh good, I’ve got a ring; it’s going to stop.’ It didn’t stop.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Kubics are not bitter. It’s not in their genes. They were both raised by parents who were dreamers and who believed a better, colorblind society was dawning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSchylon’s parents seized the opportunity afforded them by anti-discrimination  housing laws and bought a home in a white neighborhood in the Raytown school district when she was in second grade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“My parents worked really hard so they could move to a suburban area. They wanted us to go to good schools. I’ve only ever known integrated schools and being around people that didn’t look like me,” Schylon says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMicah’s family lived in a good school district, North Kansas City. But when a federal judge ordered the Kansas City School District to enact a desegregation plan that resulted in magnet schools being built to entice white students from outside the district, Micah’s parents enthusiastically enrolled their first-grade son in an urban school. He rode in a taxi, paid for by the district, to and from school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“My parents thought the desegregation was important and that it would give me exposure that I would otherwise not have,” Micah says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike Schylon, being in the minority seemed normal to Micah. He stayed in urban schools for eight years, until 1997, when the Supreme Court deemed the Kansas City plan a failure and threw it out, forcing Micah back into his own district.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The first day of ninth grade, I walked in and everything looked suddenly, dramatically different. That’s when I noticed what life had been like before,” Micah says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter graduating from North Kansas City High, Micah got his undergraduate degree at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and then went to historically black Howard University to get a master’s and a doctorate in political science.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“African-American politics was my specialty, so where better to do that than Howard? Or, more to the point, it is about the only place to do it,” Micah says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSchylon earned a bachelor’s in political science at the University of Missouri and got a job working for the Kansas City Council, where she met Micah. They are both still at City Hall; she is in Public Works, and he leads planning at the Full Employment Council.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReflecting on the legacy of the Civil Rights Act, Micah says, “Racism isn’t as personal and vitriolic today. It’s not ‘I just hate you’ like it was before. Poll after poll shows that people, particularly young people, don’t think that racism exists at all anymore. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“If that is your mindset, it is noble, but it also stops you from doing something about the inequalities that are baked into the system. That’s why you get the Supreme Court last year getting rid of the real teeth of the Voting Rights Act.… We can say we are equal under the law, and it’s true in this big, purely legalistic sense, but in terms of what real people go through every day — it’s not.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Schylon, the idealism behind the Civil Rights Act is worth striving for, despite setbacks. Even though the expensive Kansas City desegregation plan failed, attending integrated schools enriched both their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“In our formative years, we had to learn to get along with others, not as black or white, but simply as people. I think that is what allowed us to be open to a friendship and eventually marry.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe is also optimistic that, one day, a single check will get dropped on the table after dessert.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","seo":{"keywords":""},"_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/stories/614443?publication=kansascity"},"home_section":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/3189"},"home_publication":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/publications/kansascity"},"lead_media":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/images/614442?publication=kansascity","asset":{"id":614442,"file_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/news/special-reports/civil-rights-act-turns-50/p7c8a9/picture614442/alternates/FREE_1140/MICAHSCHYLONCUBIC%20MA%20061914%20DRE.jpg","publication":{"short_name":"kansascity","long_name":"The Kansas City Star"},"modified_date":"2014-06-26T19:21:53Z","published_date":"2014-06-25T16:00:31Z","credit":"","thumbnail":"https://www.kansascity.com/news/special-reports/civil-rights-act-turns-50/p7c8a9/picture614442/alternates/FREE_1140/MICAHSCHYLONCUBIC%20MA%20061914%20DRE.jpg"}},"related":[{"href":"/newsapi/v1/images/614442?publication=kansascity"}]},"_embedded":{"inline":null}},{"id":614015,"web_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/news/special-reports/civil-rights-act-turns-50/article614015.html","type":"story","title":"KC nun remembers her walk in history","publication":{"short_name":"kansascity","long_name":"The Kansas City Star"},"modified_date":"2014-06-26T19:26:15Z","published_date":"2014-06-28T19:00:00Z","authors":[],"summary":"","body":"\u003cdiv xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSister Rosemary Flanigan \u003c/strong\u003ewill never forget kneeling down in her habit  in  the dusty Alabama dirt to pray, just three days after a group of young black protesters had been beaten bloody during a 1965 march for voting rights in Selma, Ala.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore that bloody spring Sunday incident led national news broadcasts, she knew very little about how ugly the fight for civil rights had become. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e So when a fellow Sister of St. Joseph of Carondelet asked her to join a contingent of Catholic priests and five other Missouri nuns, among others, on a flight to Selma, she accepted.

Instead, the nuns and priests talked to the swarming media and explained why they were there.

One day it was only 17 degrees,” Marcus, 94, recalls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was mid-December 1958, and a group called the Community Committee for Social Action was striking back after the stores had refused to negotiate privately to end discrimination against black customers, who weren’t allowed to try on clothes or hats or eat in the stores’ restaurants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe pickets were peaceful. “A lot of white people didn’t even know what it was about. They would ask, ‘You mean you can’t eat here?’” Marcus says. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe committee  evolved out of the city’s scores of black social clubs. Marcus’ club, the Twin Citians, wrote letters to  the other clubs to create a united front after some prominent African-American preachers  declined to lead a protest against the big stores, feeling it was too soon for such a bold move.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We thought it was a shame that we spent so much money downtown and couldn’t even eat there,” Marcus says.

Two months later, so did Jones Store and Emery, Bird, Thayer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuilding on that momentum, in April 1962, black leaders muscled an ordinance through the city council banning discrimination in hotels and restaurants. Another ordinance extending equal rights to basically any business open to the public passed in October 1963, nine months ahead of the Civil Rights Act. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut after the national act passed, Marcus says, “everything changed.

Crime rose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1991, frustrated that pizza chains would not deliver to the neighborhood, Wilson learned how to make pizza, took over a neighborhood market his father had opened in 1979 and turned it into a pizza shop: Wilson’s Pizza and Grill. (His father moved across the street and opened a hardware store, which he still operates.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the next 20 years, Wilson watched as the Kansas City, Kan., neighborhood continued to deteriorate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“When I opened, in the area from Seventh and Quindaro to 27th and Brown, there were five grocery stores: two Safeways, a Kroger’s, an A\u0026amp;P and Food Fest,” he says. “Now there are none.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn his block, Wilson has seen a beauty school, a shoe shop, a print shop and a doughnut shop go out of business.

summary = '''

A control that allows actively selected state in a list of children. This is very similar to the <iron-selector> component in the Polymer project if you're familiar with that. All it does is keep track of what child has been selected and provides a visual class to show the user what they have selected. Pretty boring on its own.

Couple this with data binding allowed in AMP, and you can do some fun things. Take a gallery using `<amp-carousel>` for example. If we add a thumbnail strip underneath declared with `<amp-selector>`, when a user clicks a thumbnail the component fires an event that the carousel can use to show the corresponding image.

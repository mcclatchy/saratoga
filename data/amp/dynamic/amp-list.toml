This component fetches a JSON file remotely and can run the data through a mustache template. Although it's probably not something the be included in a story body by reporters, it may come in useful when building the bottom of the story page or in personaliation."

*Note:* There is a cousin component called `<amp-live-list>` that can refresh without reloading the page. Our time on site is probably short enough this doesn't matter though.

summary = '''
I really didn't like Polymer's implementation of animation and this is basically a copy of that concept. The Polymer team eventually bailed on the whole idea and told devs to just use a JS/CSS one-two-punch combo, but AMP is stuck with this. It can do several things, but one of the cooler ones is to trigger an animation when an element hits the viewport. 

For each animation we want to try to do I'll check against this documentation.

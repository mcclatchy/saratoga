The plan goes to the full council Oct. 1 for consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There’s a lot of things that we don’t have that we’ve been asked about over the years,” Park Services Director Greg Ruether told the committee. “What new could go into this location?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe budget for the park improvements is $3 million and Ruether said the approved concept is designed to keep to that funding limit. Of the $3 million, $1 million is coming in a donation from retired car dealer Frank Thompson, a longtime philanthropist from Overland Park, and his wife Evangeline. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn Aug. 6, the city council approved an agreement that calls for Santa Fe Commons Park to be renamed Thompson Park once the upgrades are completed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmenities would include improved restrooms and shelters, a water feature with spray or mist, a contemporary children’s playground, natural play areas and space for table tennis, and a new open performance venue with a “paper airplane” shaped roof that would be a nod to Overland Park’s transportation past. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe conceptual plan was dubbed “Park Stroll,” by the Omaha-based RDG Planning \u0026amp; Design landscape architecture firm, which came up with \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article213247329.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efour concepts for the city\u003c/a\u003e to consider over the summer. Two concepts were for the park only, and two were for incorporating the farmers’ market into the park. Following several public forums and meetings with downtown business advocates and other stakeholders, Ruether said, the “Park Stroll” concept was the consensus choice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt would preserve the existing Carriage House, which dates from the early 1900s, and keep as many of the healthy trees as possible. It calls for replacing the deteriorating bandstand and broken sidewalks and fixing or replacing other aging infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBruce Niedermyer with RDG said the southern half of the park would remain as open and natural as possible, to create an urban lawn, almost like a “front yard,” for the nearby Santa Fe Towers apartments, whose many residents cherish the park and didn’t want substantial changes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRuether said he had appreciated his meeting with the Santa Fe Towers residents, describing them as “the nicest and most opinionated people.” He said the debate over moving the farmers’ market had been polarizing, but it was a useful discussion, and the feedback from \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article213247329.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewell over 100 city residents\u003c/a\u003e and other stakeholders had been crucial to the city’s decision on the best direction for the park. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany people felt shoehorning the farmers’ market into the park would reduce the desirable green space while also cramping the market. Parking was also a concern. City officials have determined that improving the market at its present location honors its 36-year history and is the best option, although those construction upgrades will have to be phased in over time to minimize disruptions to vendors and customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome residents now have a new concern: they’ve objected to the renaming, arguing it was done with no public input. They believe the Santa Fe Commons name should be preserved and is a better tie to Overland Park’s historical connection to the Santa Fe Trail. But the committee took no testimony on the renaming Wednesday night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbout three dozen people attended Wednesday’s public hearing, and several testified that they were relieved and pleased with the chosen concept.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think that can make a beautiful addition to our city,” said Linda McGuckin, who lives nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOthers questioned some of the elements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I treasure the fact that the park is natural,” said Rich Kaufman, adding that he thinks all the new park structures will detract from its natural character. He thought the “paper airplane” shaped roof for the performance space was silly and advised, “Get rid of that element. Make it a glider.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKaufman and several others also wondered why the park improvements need to occur now. They suggested the city should wait until multiple downtown construction projects are completed in a few years to see if park changes are really needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Councilman Paul Lyons opposed waiting and said the city can coordinate the park construction with other projects to try to reduce parking problems and inconvenience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think we should go full steam ahead,” he said. “I think it’s going to be a great amenity.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the council approves the concept, more detailed designs go to the Overland Park Planning Commission, probably late this year or early next year. Ruether said the schedule calls for construction in 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","seo":{"keywords":"Overland Park, Santa Fe Commons, park, farmers' market, development, improvements, stroll, playground, downtown"},"_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/stories/217887490?publication=kansascity"},"home_section":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/2595","asset":{"id":2595,"name":"Government \u0026 Politics","taxonomy":"News|Local|GovtPolitics||","web_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/","unique_name":"politics_government","_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/2595"}}}},"home_publication":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/publications/kansascity"},"lead_media":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/images/217917550?publication=kansascity","asset":{"id":217917550,"file_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/hrtuz0/picture217917550/alternates/FREE_1140/IMG_2410.JPG","caption":"The existing carriage house welcomes visitors to Santa Fe Commons Park.","credit":"lhorsley@kcstar.com","photographer":"Lynn Horsley","thumbnail":"https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/hrtuz0/picture217917550/alternates/FREE_1140/IMG_2410.JPG","publication":{"id":0,"long_name":"The Kansas City Star","short_name":"kansascity","time_zone":"","web_url":"","analytics":{"market_code":"","site_file":""},"_links":{"self":{"href":""}}},"modified_date":"2018-09-06T15:41:26Z","published_date":"2018-09-06T15:20:31Z"}},"related":[{"href":"/newsapi/v1/images/217917550?publication=kansascity"},{"href":"/newsapi/v1/videos/177437931?publication=kansascity"},{"href":"/newsapi/v1/images/217916990?publication=kansascity"},{"href":"/newsapi/v1/stories/217438320?publication=kansascity"}]},"_embedded":{"inline":null}}}},"publication":{"id":0,"long_name":"The Kansas City Star","short_name":"kansascity","time_zone":"","web_url":"","analytics":{"market_code":"","site_file":""},"_links":{"self":{"href":""}}},"published_date":"2018-09-06T16:46:31Z"},{"id":217915210,"title":"‘We’re glad to have him’: Missouri GOP on Billy Long auctioneering away protester","type":"story","_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/stories/217915210?publication=kansascity","asset":{"id":217915210,"web_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/missouri/article217915210.html","type":"story","title":"‘We’re glad to have him’: Missouri GOP on Billy Long auctioneering away protester","publication":{"short_name":"kansascity","long_name":"The Kansas City Star"},"modified_date":"2018-09-06T16:42:15Z","published_date":"2018-09-06T16:17:34Z","authors":[{"name":"Matt Campbell","email":"mcampbell@kcstar.com"}],"summary":"\u003cdiv xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eMissouri Congressman Billy Long, a Republican from Springfield, drew laughs Wednesday by using his auctioneering skill to drown out a protester during a House hearing on free speech.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","body":"\u003cdiv xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eU.S. Rep.

was debated again Wednesday by the man who largely wants to bring back the former governor’s tax cuts and the woman who helped lead the Legislature away from the conservative Republican’s control.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRepublican Kris Kobach, Democrat Laura Kelly and independent Greg Orman clashed over policy in the first debate of the general election campaign for Kansas governor, with their views on tax and budget cuts showing major distinctions between the candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eKobach wants to cut income and sales taxes, along with the state budget, while Kelly, a Democratic state senator from Topeka, called for Medicaid expansion and a quality education for all Kansans and lamented the impact Brownback’s earlier tax cuts have had on the state.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“I’ve never heard him tell us exactly what he would cut,” Kelly said to Kobach at the event in Overland Park. “Are we going to cut schools, are we going to cut foster care? Are we going to cut roads? What are you going to cut, Kris, to pay for your tax cut?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOrman, who aligns more closely with Kelly on a number of issues, focused much of his energy in the debate on deriding how Democrats and Republicans have run the state when they’ve had control. He also called for “top to bottom” criminal justice reform.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe candidates traded barbs over what role state Supreme Court justices should have on school funding. Kobach supports a constitutional amendment that would largely remove the justices from the process, while Kelly was a hard “no” on the move. Orman said it didn’t make sense to have a constitutional amendment while the state is in the middle of a lawsuit concerning its education system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe debate often found Kelly and Orman on one side with Kobach on the other, including on medical marijuana. Kobach said he opposed making it legal while the others were for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAll three candidates agreed, however, for perhaps the only time of the entire debate, that they supported legalizing sports betting in Kansas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe three candidates were critical of one another in close to equal doses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAt one point, Orman singled out Kobach’s immigration views.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“I almost think the idea, Kris, that you think that we need to get rid of all immigrants in Kansas, all illegal immigrants in Kansas, just disqualifies you to be governor,” Orman said. “It’s clearly a red meat issue for your base.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eKobach, who defeated Gov. Jeff Colyer in the GOP primary, made a point of using his tenure as Kansas secretary of state as a sign that he is ready for a promotion to governor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“I’ve shown the people of Kansas that I deliver results,” Kobach said, pointing to his work passing voter ID laws through the Legislature early during his time in statewide office.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEach of the candidates was asked, “which action by the Trump administration do you support the most and which do you most oppose?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eKobach, long a Trump supporter who was endorsed by the president the day before the GOP primary, applauded the federal tax cuts pushed by Trump. But he opposed the delay when it came to reversing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the Obama-era program giving children who arrived in the U.S. illegally the chance to avoid being deported.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“President Trump eventually got there,” Kobach said. “I just would have gotten there faster.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOrman said he appreciated Trump’s support for apprenticeship programs and technical education. But he said he was concerned abut the president’s approach on tariffs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Ultimately, I understand the strategy, but I think it’s a very risky approach” Orman said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe harshest criticism of Trump came from Kelly, who said she had racked her brain for what she liked best and joked it was the attention paid to golf under Trump. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think the thing that I most abhor about the Trump administration is the divisiveness, the incivility, the xenophobia, misogyny that comes out of that administration on a regular basis,” Kelly said. “I think it’s tearing our country apart and I think we need a uniter, not a divider.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:217887945% --\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","seo":{"keywords":"kansas governor, Kris Kobach, Laura Kelly, Greg Orman, debate, race, Republican, Democrat, trump, taxes"},"_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/stories/217815605?publication=kansascity"},"home_section":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/2595","asset":{"id":2595,"name":"Government \u0026 Politics","taxonomy":"News|Local|GovtPolitics||","web_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/","unique_name":"politics_government","_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/2595"}}}},"home_publication":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/publications/kansascity"},"lead_media":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/videos/217868545?publication=kansascity","asset":{"id":217868545,"brightcove_id":"5831188955001","title":"Candidates for Kansas governor talk tax cuts and growing the state’s economy.","description":"Kansas gubernatorial candidates Democrat Laura Kelly, Republican Kris Kobach and independent Greg Orman faced-off for a debate Wednesday at the DoubleTree Hotel in Overland Park.

Two would amend the Missouri Constitution and a third would legalize cannabis by state statute.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne constitutional amendment, promoted by an organization called A New Approach Missouri, would allow doctors to prescribe cannabis for 10 specific medical issues, including epilepsy, cancer, chronic pain and PTSD. The measure would tax medical marijuana sales and direct the revenue toward health for veterans through the Missouri Veterans Commission.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second constitutional amendment is promoted by Springfield, Mo., lawyer and physician Brad Bradshaw. It would create a state research institute that could determine what medical conditions can be treated with marijuana.

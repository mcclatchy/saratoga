A day after Mahomes tied a franchise record with six touchdowns in the 42-37 win in Pittsburgh, Chiefs coach Andy Reid started there.</p><p> <!-- %asset:218539425% --> </p><p>“The thing that I think gets overlooked in this one is they threw a bunch at him,” Reid said Monday of the Steelers’ defense. “Which I thought was going to be an important thing for him to work with.”</p><p>The film room identifies the coverages and the sources of potential blitzes and pressures. The Chiefs spent considerable time helping<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>Mahomes distinguish them.</p><p>But he doesn’t get hit in practice. The risk of standing in the pocket isn’t elevated in the same manner it is during a game.</p><p>Reid said Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Keith Butler “threw the kitchen sink” at the Chiefs with different pressures. To be sure, the offensive line deserves a major share of the credit for that being a non-factor, which Reid, Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce were quick to point out.</p><p>But Mahomes earned his share, too. Rather than scrambling and breaking the plan of a play, he manipulated the pocket.</p><p>“For a young guy, you wanna see how he handles the blitz and/or any pressure (and) how he settles in the pocket,” Reid said. “There are subtle things that can take place off of a three-technique or a one-technique. And if you’re getting a little pressure there, how do you move and still keep your eyes downfield? There are a bunch of little things in there that take place.</p><p>“Until you’re live — until you take that yellow jersey off — you’re not sure exactly. We get to see it here, (and) he seems to be doing that pretty good.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p>A couple of plays — one from each of the first two weeks — serve as a prime example.</p><p>On Sunday in Pittsburgh, Mahomes had Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt bearing down on him. The play call was actually a run-pass option, meaning Mahomes could have simply handed the ball to Kareem Hunt and avoided a hit. Instead, he faked the handoff, then fired to Tyreek Hill for first-down yardage.</p><p>It mirrored a similar sequence against the Los Angeles Chargers in the opener.</p><p>“He’s done that the last couple weeks. He’s pretty good with that,” Reid said. “There’s going to be games where he’s going to have to maneuver some things, but he’s doing that right now. And the line’s giving him enough time right now, which is an important thing for a young quarterback.”</p><p>As for the coverages, Mahomes was able to shift the secondary with his eyes. He did it on each of the touchdowns to Kelce.</p><p>His reads have been true. Well, for the most part. Moments after Reid said the amount of nuance encountering Mahomes on Sunday might have been overlooked, he finished the same thought with acknowledgment that not all of it was handled perfectly — that even after a six-touchdown day, there remains opportunity for development.</p><p>“He’s using his instincts. He’s using his guys. He’s seeing it right now,” Reid said. “He’s just gotta keep growing with that. There were some things that he could’ve done better. I don’t wanna take anything away from him, but he’s a young kid, man, and he’s learning as we go. You’re seeing it. There’s room for improvement there.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:217344670% --> </p></div>",

The proposal — <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_Amendment_1,_Lobbying,_Campaign_Finance,_and_Redistricting_Initiative_(2018)\" target=\"_blank\">Amendment 1</a> — offers several changes to the state’s constitution, all involving the state legislature.</p><p><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_Amendment_1,_Lobbying,_Campaign_Finance,_and_Redistricting_Initiative_(2018)\" target=\"_self\">The amendment</a> includes lobbying restrictions and a limit on lobbyist gifts, redistricting reform, campaign finance reform and changes to make state government more transparent. Green decided the measure contained too many different subjects, a process he called “logrolling.”</p><p> “The Court’s review of this Bunyanesque initiative leaves this Court with an abiding conviction that it is the quintessential logroll,” Green wrote. </p><p>His ruling leaves us with an abiding conviction that he removed the measure from the ballot for partisan reasons.</p><p><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Daniel_Green\" target=\"_self\">Judge Green is a Republican</a>. The plaintiffs’ <a href=\"https://www.abc17news.com/news/appeal-filed-after-clean-missouri-amendment-removed-from-nov-ballot/795134754\" target=\"_self\">case was argued</a> by <a href=\"https://www.gravesgarrett.com/member/edward-d-greim/\" target=\"_self\">Edward Greim</a>, who is the law partner of Todd Graves, the <a href=\"https://gop.com/leaders/state-chairman-todd-graves-mo/\" target=\"_self\">chairman of the Missouri Republican Party</a>.

Limits on lobbying and drawing legislative districts more fairly should be supported by every Missourian who wants open, honest government.</p><p>It’s true that Democrats are involved in the Clean Missouri project. But they aren’t trying to impose ethics reforms on Missouri; they’re simply seeking a statewide vote. Republicans should support that, too.</p><p>Some Republicans understand this. <a href=\"https://www.cleanmissouri.org/support/\" target=\"_self\">Former Sen. Jack Danforth</a> has endorsed Amendment 1, and a trio of current and former GOP state lawmakers has filed a friend-of-the-court brief arguing that the measure is ballot-worthy.</p><p>Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican, says the Clean Missouri initiative involves a single subject and should go to voters. Clean Missouri submitted more than 340,000 signatures asking that the proposal go on the November ballot.</p><p>They all understand what Green does not: In Missouri, ballot initiatives must be interpreted broadly, with every close call going to the people — not legislators, lobbyists or judges. </p><p>“The trial court’s judgment must be reversed because it misapplied the law,” Clean Missouri supporters told the appeals court in a brief filed over the weekend. “The people should be allowed to vote on the wisdom of the measure.”</p><p>We agree. If opponents of Clean Missouri want to argue against it, or claim Missouri’s legislature is a model of ethical behavior now, they should do so in a campaign.</p><p>They should not be allowed to use the courts to circumvent the judgment of Missourians. </p><p>The Missouri Court of Appeals in Kansas City will hear arguments in the case Thursday, and may rule that day. All Missourians who believe in clean, open government will be watching.</p></div>",

Justin Hughes and Cody Fletcher, a pair of unheralded linebackers not listed on the depth chart, played meaningful snaps. And Eli Walker made his first start at strong safety.</p><p>Those moves were anything but one-time personnel changes made during a lopsided victory. All of those players may be needed again this week in a pressure-packed game at West Virginia.</p><p>Injuries have already hit the Wildcats hard on defense, and they could be down several key players when they take on the No. 12 Mountaineers and their explosive offense. A tough test just got even more difficult.</p><p>“That’s probably one of the worst teams you could line up short-handed against,” K-State coach Bill Snyder said. “They’re a very prolific offense, which they’ve proven over time — not just this year, year in and year out — and they have developed a great deal of balance in their offense.”</p><p>Here are the K-State defensive players who may not be healthy enough to play this weekend:</p><ul><li>Denzel Goolsby: The junior strong safety from Wichita is expected to miss at least a handful more games while he recovers from an unspecified injury sustained against Mississippi State. He wasn’t even on the sideline for the UTSA game. Walker, who made five tackles against the Roadrunners, is the next man up.</li><li>Elijah Sullivan: K-State has taken things slow with the junior linebacker as he recovered from a preseason knee injury. Though he is arguably the best linebacker on the roster, he came off the bench in the first two games and didn’t play at all against UTSA. Consider him questionable this week. If he is unable to play against the Mountaineers, the Wildcats will need strong efforts from Sam Sizelove, Hughes and Fletcher.</li><li>Kevion McGee: The junior defensive back was a pleasant surprise for the Wildcats when he broke up a team high four passes against South Dakota. But he has rarely played since and didn’t see the field against UTSA. Snyder said he is dealing with an injury and is not sure when he will return. Without him, K-State’s secondary has struggled to find depth.</li></ul><p>Those potential absences create new challenges for K-State, which will have its hands full with West Virginia’s offense.</p><p>With Heisman Trophy contender Will Grier at quarterback, dynamic playmakers Gary Jennings and David Sills at receiver and Leddie Brown at running back, the Mountaineers are hard for any defense (even at full strength) to stop.</p><p>West Virginia is averaging 586 yards and 46 points per game.</p><p>The new faces on K-State’s defense will need to mature quickly.</p><p>“Being short-handed is not something you envision and something you want,” Snyder said, “but we’re no different than anybody else. If you have somebody that has to step up and play in place of someone they have to be well prepared to do as well as the other one. It’s the next-up thought, probably, but that’s what you do when you coach. You get guys prepared to step into those situations.”</p></div>",

Vernon Howard, president of the <a href=\"https://www.sclcgkc.org/\" target=\"_self\">Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Kansas City. </a></p><p>“As a civil rights organization, our interest is the victim’s (Mr. Stokes’) rights. To the extent this rescinding assists in reversing the false and very unfair public criminalization of Mr. Stokes then this decision is good,” Howard said Monday. </p><p>“However, the narrative that Mr. Stokes was a threat is untrue and still needs addressing.”</p><p>“This young African American male was a noble and positive contributor to his daughter, family, church, and community. To our knowledge his daughter and family have yet to receive a proper and full restorative response,” Howard said.</p><p> <!-- %asset:104810061% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Blue Valley Northwest senior Christian Braun hails from Burlington, Kan., the home of former Kansas basketball player Tyrel Reed.</p><p>“As a matter of fact, Tyrel’s sister, Lacie, used to babysit my boys. Christian used to put his high-tops on and walk around in them all the time. It was cute,” Lisa Braun said Monday after her son, Christian, orally committed to play at Reed’s alma mater.</p><p><span class=\"s1\">Braun, a </span>combo guard/small forward who is Rivals.com’s No. 112-rated player in the recruiting Class of 2019, chose KU over Kansas State, Illinois, Missouri and others.</p><p><span class=\"s1\">Christian’s brother, Parker, is a freshman forward at Missouri — alma mater of Lisa Braun, who moved with her husband, Donald, and the kids to Overland Park for the start of Christian’s high school career four years ago.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“He’s always been a KU fan since he was little, just because of the area we grew up in and his dad went to KU,” the former Lisa Sandbothe said of Christian. “There’s always been the Border War in our house of course, because I played at Mizzou. The Border War continues,” she added with a laugh.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Parker Braun, a 6-8 freshman, and Christian, who stands 6-6, both played for the MoKan Elite AAU team as well as Blue Valley Northwest. Parker — he was not recruited by KU — will be placed on scholarship at Mizzou starting his sophomore season. No scholarships were available for 2018-19.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Christian Braun’s commitment to KU completed a whirlwind couple of weeks for the two-time state champion who averaged 14.2 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.1 assists a game his junior year at BV Northwest.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Christian — he played quite well at the Peach Jam in South Carolina and a tourney in Las Vegas to conclude the summer AAU circuit — was offered a scholarship by KU on Aug. 30 during his unofficial campus visit.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">At that time, he also had offers from MU, Oklahoma, K-State, Texas Tech, Wake Forest and others.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">KU coach Bill Self and assistant Norm Roberts held an in-home visit with the Braun family on Sunday night in Overland Park and Christian offered his commitment just hours later on Monday.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“We discussed where they thought I would fit in and stuff like that,” Braun said Monday.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“It feels right for me and my family. KU has always been a place I wanted to go. I grew up in a small town in Kansas. It’s always been a dream for me. I’m pretty excited for the opportunity when I got it. I figured I should take it and go from there,” Braun added.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Braun made the announcement shortly before 2 p.m. Monday, with this post on Twitter: “First I would like to thank my parents for loving me and caring for me throughout my life and sacrificing everything to put me in the best position for my future. I would also like to thank my coaches for guiding me throughout this process. I would like to thank MoKan for giving me a platform to showcase my ability for the past six years. I am committing to the University of Kansas!”</span></p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p>Braun, who made one official visit, to K-State, was to have traveled to Oklahoma this coming weekend and Illinois in October. Instead he’s committed to sign a letter-of-intent with KU in November.</p><p><span class=\"s1\">“Talking to Coach Self and Roberts … it seems the right fit for me and my family,” Christian Braun said. “I really like the coaching staff. I met the players. I really like them. Obviously I’ve been a KU fan a long time. It seemed to be the right place for me. I can help the program. I think it’s going to be special.”</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">He has talked to Self about the role he’ll play at KU.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“I am more a 2,” he said. “I play a lot of the 2 and 3 and also a bit of 1 if he needs it. Just versatility is something me and coach talk about a lot.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“Right now I’m taking it all in,” added Braun. “I don’t know it’s necessarily hit me yet. Just the opportunity being that it’s Kansas. Once everything settles down I’ll be able to look at it. I’m just pretty excited.”</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Lisa Braun (she indicated the family’s last name is pronounced Brown) said she’s happy she’ll have two sons playing major college basketball in the area.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“They’ve been watching him for years,” Lisa said of KU coaches attending MoKan Elite games and BV Northwest contests. “They’d see him whenever he went to team camps at KU with Coach Fritz (Ed, BV Northwest). Our family … we’re just basketball fans in general. I don’t think we’re real particular of what school or whatever, we just like good ball. That’s what he (Self) is known for. He’s done a super job. You can’t beat the statistics the Jayhawks have had over the years. And we trust him. He’s a go-getter, a class act guy. I don’t think he (Christian) could have picked a better coach,” Lisa added.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"> Proud MU Tiger Lisa would love to see KU and MU play again, especially with sons at both institutions.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“Oh yes. If we can’t have them play together, it’s always fun to have both kids on the same court,” Lisa Braun said.</span></p><p>Braun’s commitment is KU’s first from a prospect in the Class of 2019. The Jayhawks will have at least one more scholarship available after the departure of senior Lagerald Vick. More scholarships are expected to be available with several non-seniors likely to consider entering the 2019 NBA Draft.</p><p><!-- %asset:217344780% --><br/><br/></p></div>",

But that mantle may have shifted to Rutgers following the Jayhawks’ 55-14 victory over the Scarlet Knight. </p><p>And even if Le Batard doesn’t have harsh words for Rutgers, others unloaded on the team and coach Chris Ash. </p><p>Steve Politi of the Star-Ledger wrote a column with the headline, “<a href=\"https://www.nj.com/rutgersfootball/index.ssf/2018/09/rutgers-kansas_politis_5_observations.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Ash has no excuse for Rutgers’ most humiliating loss ever.”</a></p><p>“I write this without a hint of exaggeration: This might be the most demoralizing, humiliating, unacceptable loss<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>in the modern history of Rutgers<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>football, and yes, I know that’s a high bar to clear,” Politi wrote.</p><p>“You want to go back to the Dark Ages and dig one up that’s worse? Knock yourself out. But don’t try to sell me that 78-0 to Michigan or 80-7 to West Virginia was worse than this, any of those dispiriting Villanova or New Hampshire losses were worse than this, or anything else in recent memory tops what happened here on Saturday afternoon for rock bottom. </p><p>“The Scarlet Knights came to Kansas and got run out of the building by the team that was supposed to be — emphasis on<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>supposed to be<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>— the worst Power 5 team in the country. I think, after the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>Jayhawks’ 55-14 victory, we clearly know which program has earned that title now. ...</p><p>“Rutgers embarrassed itself on Saturday. Rutgers was completely unprepared to play against a team that loss to Nicholls State in its opener and just snapped a 46-game road losing streak last week. Rutgers was steamrolled by a program that exists so the kind folks have a way to pass the time until basketball season out here.” </p><p>Whew, that’s harsh. </p><p>But Politi wasn’t the only one to rip Rutgers for the loss.</p><p>Aaron Breitman wrote a story on SB Nation’s Rutgers blog with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.onthebanks.com/2018/9/16/17864768/rutgers-football-alarm-bells-ring-in-epic-loss-to-kansas-chris-ash-pat-hobbs-big-ten-ohio-state\" target=\"_blank\">“Rutgers Football: Alarm bells ring in epic loss to Kansas.”</a></p><p>“The loss to the Jayhawks, long considered the worst power five program in college football, was the ultimate embarrassment,” Breitman wrote. “There is no other way to characterize Rutgers football right now other than being in full crisis mode. That’s not being an alarmist, that’s being a realist. ...</p><p>“<span>The team looked uninspired in a hugely important game in their season and didn’t show much fight in a second half with the issue still in doubt. Where is the fire, the swagger, the pride? I’ll repeat, all of these things happened against the program formerly considered the worst of all the power five teams.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p>“This team has a chance to dispose of that title in three weeks when they play Illinois, but that’s the reality we are in my friends. The perception of Rutgers football nationally and within the Big Ten is that it’s a joke and they proved it by losing by six touchdowns to Kansas. They didn’t cover the spread of the Ohio State game ... against Kansas. ...</p><p>“The bottom line is the product on the field is horrendous right now and at the end of the day, it comes down to coaching. You can make the talent disparity argument in getting blown out to Ohio State. There isn’t a significant disparity between Rutgers and Kansas. Certainly not six touchdowns worth.“</p><p>And finally, the Washington Post chimed in ... sort of. Jacob Bogage wrote a piece with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/09/15/only-rutgers-could-make-kansas-look-this-good-p-s-kansas-is-still-bad/?utm_term=.cf0d50fbad57\" target=\"_blank\">“Only Rutgers could make Kansas look this good.

              "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>After a quiet preseason and season-opener, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Sammy Watkins turned in a 100-yard receiving performance against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Week 2 win. </p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Sammy Watkins ran from right to left, darting behind quarterback Patrick Mahomes in time to grab the handoff on a jet sweep. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">He turned the corner, splitting a pair of Pittsburgh defenders and darted up the field. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Steelers dived at Watkins, grasping at his feet. Another tried to grab him from the side, but Watkins extended his arm and shoved him out of the way. Finally, Vince Williams wrapped Watkins up, but the wide receiver still fought for a few extra yards, dipping his shoulder and pushing forward until he was finally brought down seven yards from the goal line. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Watkins, of course, is a receiver by trade, but that 31-yard run in the first quarter of the Chiefs’ 42-37 win at Pittsburgh ultimately settled him down and helped him churn out his best performance since coming to Kansas City.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Kind of felt like a running back,” he said Sunday. “It felt good. It got me going early on. Got tackled and after that, it was kind of like, ‘OK, I’m here.’ Got all the butterflies out.” </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Prior to that long run, Watkins had three catches for 67 yards. By the end of the game, he had seven catches for 100 yards, averaging 16.7 yards per catch. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Though he wasn’t on the receiving end of one of Mahomes’ six touchdown throws, Watkins’ involvement in the offense was somewhat of a welcome relief after a quiet preseason and season-opener. As a new addition to the Chiefs in the offseason, Watkins has immersed himself in the complexities Andy Reid’s playbook. The payoff has been a slow build. But Sunday in Pittsburgh was a sign of positive progress. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Not only did Watkins catch six of seven targets, the lone incompletion coming as Mahomes overthrew him in the end zone early in the third quarter, but he also showed his strength as he broke tackles and ran through contact. Through two weeks, Watkins has 54 yards after catch, averaging six per reception. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I think Sammy Watkins showed everybody some stuff and opened some eyes today to show that he is the real deal,” tight end Travis Kelce said. “He’s going to be one heck of a weapon for us this year.” </p><p dir=\"ltr\">A week earlier against the Chargers, Watkins had three catches on five targets for just 21 yards — a far cry from his earlier days in Buffalo when he infamously demanded to have 10 targets a game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">But Watkins is in a new system now and his mentality has evolved. He’s playing with an array of offensive threats, and he’s OK being selfless.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I’m not going to have 100 yards every game,” Watkins said. “That’s not realistic. But to be out there playing hard, playing physical, blocking. I think that’s what it’s about. It’s not about who got the stats and stuff like that. If I’m playing hard, playing fast and we’re getting wins, that’s what it’s about.” </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Everyone got involved in the offense in Sunday’s win, reflecting what Reid and his players preached throughout training camp and the preseason. It also looked entirely different from what Reid schemed up for Week 1, where most everything flowed through speedy wide receiver Tyreek Hill. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">This time, the emphasis seemed to shift to tight end Travis Kelce and Watkins from the very beginning. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kelce was targeted once on the first drive and caught the touchdown the second. Watkins had back-to-back catches in the second drive, including one that went for 40 yards. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I’m happy for Sammy,” Reid said. “Sammy has gone through a few things through his career, and he comes here as one of the big names, he saw what he is. You get that ball in his hand, and he’s an explosive runner. It’s like you have a running back when he has that ball, big, strong and physical. So, I need to do a better job of making sure we get it to him. Travis Kelce, too, he had a nice game today. A lot of positives.” </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Even with a solid performance, Watkins knows he still has more learning to do. He’s catching on to Reid’s schemes, but he’s not there yet.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“There’s no rush,” Watkins said. “It’s the second game. The coaches are just going to continue to put me in the right positions. I’m going to continue to grow with this offense and today just shows how well we can play together if we continue to work together.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\"> <!-- %asset:217344700% --> </p></div>",

    "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n            <p>Johnson County will accept nearly 1,500 provisional ballots either in full or in part, but there is confusion about the status of some unaffiliated voters. </p>\n          </div>",
    "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Small numbers of ballots in Johnson and Sedgwick counties are at the center of dispute between the backers of Gov. Jeff Colyer and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach in a primary race that may eventually be settled in court.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kansas law allows unaffiliated voters to declare their party on Election Day and vote in the primary, but the supporters of the two Republican rivals disagree whether this law puts the burden on voters or poll workers to ensure the paperwork is properly completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">And the state’s two largest counties <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216489915.html\">don’t appear to be handling the issue uniformly.</a></p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker, the deputy whom Kobach has tapped to oversee vote counting in the historically close election, said in a news release Sunday night that “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216584870.html\">Rucker issued his release less than 12 hours</a> before the bulk of the state’s counties, including its two most populous, were set to begin canvassing, a process that will determine whether <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216446680.html\">thousands of provisional ballots count</a> in a race where a few hundred votes separate the candidates. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Brant Laue, Colyer’s chief counsel, argued in a letter Monday morning that Kansas law requires counties to accept ballots from unaffiliated voters regardless of whether the registration switch was completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Laue said on letterhead from the governor’s office.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Both Johnson and<a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\"> Sedgwick counties </a>voted to accept thousands of provisional ballots Monday, but a handful of ballots in each of the counties could be at the center of litigation if the primary fails to yield a clear winner after canvassing is completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach saw his lead on Colyer grow to 206 votes by 5 p.m. as more than 60 smaller counties processed their provisional ballots. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sedgwick and Johnson counties, which account for more than 40 percent of the state’s provisional ballots, will certify their new vote totals Tuesday.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Rucker <a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\">called Sedgwick County to complain</a> immediately after the county’s canvassing board voted to approve 14 ballots where an unaffiliated voter failed to check the box for party label. He argued with the county’s lawyer about the legality of their inclusion in the vote tally. </p>\n            <h3>Confusion in JoCo</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">In Johnson County, Colyer’s campaign staff left a canvassing meeting thinking that the state’s most populous county would be counting all unaffiliated voters who cast ballots in governor primary.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">But it appears that Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker misspoke on the issue, leading to confusion about which ballots will be counted when Johnson County does its final tally on Tuesday.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Metsker referred to questions about the status of unaffiliated voters who were wrongly told to cast provisional ballots at their polling places and said votes would be counted for 57 unaffiliated voters in Johnson County who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">After the meeting, The Star asked Metsker specifically whether this meant that voters who were told to cast provisional ballots instead of declaring a party would see their votes counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“That’s correct. We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Clay Barker, Colyer’s special assistant, took Metsker’s assurances as a sign that the county was not following Rucker’s guidance.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“It would appear to me that the county commissioners, with counsel from their elections commissioner and legal counsel, decided to ignore it and do what they’ve done in the past, which is count ballots because they show a poll worker’s mistake,” said Barker, an attorney who previously served as executive director of the Kansas Republican Party.</p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216595325% -->\n            </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The Johnson County Board of Canvassers voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 provisional ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations. The 57 ballots from unaffiliated voters that declared parties are part of that total.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">But the board also voted unanimously to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons, including 35 ballots for which a voter failed to declare a party.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach’s spokeswoman, Danedri Herbert, contacted The Star shortly after the meeting to emphasize the distinction.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“I just think it’s important to understand the difference because other counties are now trying to follow Johnson County’s lead,” Herbert said.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Ed Eilert, who chairs the canvassing board and the Johnson County Commission, said he thought the distinction between which unaffiliated voters would count and which would not was clear at the meeting.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Regarding the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t count, Eilert said, most were mail-in ballots, according to his notes.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“There’s a place on there if you’re unaffiliated to mark the party and they didn’t,” Eilert said. “That’s the difference between the two.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The canvassing board, which is made up by the county’s commissioners, also voted to accept 275 ballots in part. Most of these ballots are from people who went to the wrong polling place on Election Day. Their votes for all statewide races, such as the primary for governor, will count.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"> Colyer’s campaign referred to Laue’s letter when asked about the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t be counted.</p>\n            <h3>More scrutiny in Sedgwick County</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The issue of unaffiliated voters received more scrutiny in Sedgwick County.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sedgwick County Commissioner David Dennis said it would have been easy for voters to miss what he called the “tiny box” on the form.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">And Sedgwick County Commissioner Jim Howell said the voters would have had to tell election workers which party they wanted to join to obtain a ballot. He also said he thinks the election officials at the polls should have checked that the form was completed before giving a ballot to the voter. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Tabitha Lehman, the county’s election commissioner, remained neutral on the issue of whether the votes should be counted. But she did say she trains poll workers not to advise voters on how to fill out the forms because she doesn’t want them to be seen as encouraging voters to affiliate with one party or another.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The confusion for voters was scorned by Cille King, a co-president for the League of Women Voters of Kansas. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">If poll workers instructed the voter wrong, “I don’t think the voter should be penalized,” King said.</p>\n            <h3>Other counties</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">In 11 other Kansas counties surveyed by The Star that sorted through provisional and mail-in votes Monday, there was no question that previously unaffiliated voters’ ballots would be counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Rick Piepho, the county clerk and election officer of Harvey County, said unaffiliated voters should declare a party simply by going through the provisional ballot process.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“On the provisional envelope — at least on ours — there’s a box on there that says I’m declaring such-and-such ... party and we have them declare on there, so when they’re signing the provisional envelope they’re also signing that declaration,” Piepho said. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Most poll workers in these smaller counties asked unaffiliated voters to fill out a voter affiliation card or a voter registration card to declare their party, and they were given a standard ballot to vote in that party’s primary, clerks said. A few voters were asked to vote provisionally, which clerks attributed to poll worker error, but those votes were counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“They had to fill out a card in order to be able to get a ballot,” McPherson County Clerk Hollie Melroy said.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sonya Stohs, county clerk in Marshall County, said 18 unaffiliated voters at two polling places in her county were asked to fill out provisional ballots because of poll worker error, but they all counted. </p>\n            <h3>Postmarks and other issues</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Among the 898 votes thrown out Monday in Johnson County were four mail-in ballots that lacked a postmark or had an illegible postmark.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach’s office advised counties that these types of ballots could not be counted last week, which prompted Colyer to call on the state’s chief election official to recuse himself from the process.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Votes won’t count for an additional 59 people who did not provide photo ID as required by Kansas law. And 272 people registered in one party tried to vote in the other party’s primary.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">One voter died after casting a ballot, which prompted the election office to recommend the vote be treated as invalid.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“We only had one of those, thank God,” Metsker told the commissioners.</p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216341105% -->\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216340375% -->\n            </p>\n          </div>",

            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Kansas’ two biggest counties made different decisions on how to count some ballots from last week’s election, meaning that some Sedgwick County voters who messed up on a form will have their votes count, while Johnson County voters who did the same thing won’t.</p><p>The conflict only affects 49 ballots out of more 200,000 cast statewide. In an ordinary election year it probably would have gone unnoticed. </p><p>But this time, those could be critical votes with Secretary of State Kris Kobach leading Gov. Jeff Colyer in the Republican race for governor by only 206 votes at the end of the business day Monday. </p><p>At issue are disputed provisional ballots, which were cast by voters who tried to switch from no-party status to affiliating with a party so they could vote in the primary on election day.</p><p>State law allows that last-minute switch, but there is a form for that and some voters didn’t fill out the form correctly.</p><p>Sedgwick County officials voted Monday to give those voters the benefit of the doubt; Johnson County officials voted to toss the ballots out.</p><p>Those decisions affect 14 Sedgwick County votes and 35 Johnson County votes.</p><p>Overall, Sedgwick County’s election board voted to count 1,326 provisional and disputed ballots, adding them to the total votes from the Aug. 7 primary election. </p><p>The results will be announced Tuesday morning.<br/><br/></p><p>The most disputed were 14 ballots cast at the polls by unaffiliated voters who indicated they wished to declare a party and vote in the primary, but who failed to check a box indicating the party of their choice on the form.</p><p>The election board voted 4-1 to count those votes.</p><p>The board is by law made up of the members of the Sedgwick County Commission. On Monday, one commissioner, Richard Ranzau, couldn’t be there, so his seat was taken by Karen Bailey, the chief deputy county clerk who was appointed as substitute. </p><p>Bailey was the only “no” vote on counting the 14 disputed ballots.</p><p>Commissioner David Dennis said it would have been easy for voters to miss what he called the “tiny box” on the form.</p><p>And Commissioner Jim Howell said the voters would have had to tell election workers which party they wanted to join to obtain a ballot. He also said he thinks the election officials at the polls should have checked that the form was completed before giving a ballot to the voter. </p><p>Election Commissioner Tabitha Lehman remained neutral on the issue of whether the votes should be counted. But she did say she trains poll workers not to advise voters on how to fill out the forms because she doesn’t want them to be seen as encouraging voters to affiliate themselves with one party or another.</p><p>The decisions of which votes to count were part of canvassing the vote, a process that is usually ministerial and noncontroversial. But it’s been magnified this election because of the whisker-thin margin in the race for the Republican nomination for governor.</p><p>Immediately after the decision to count the 14 disputed ballots, Kobach’s assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker called to object, arguing over the legality of the decision with Sedgwick County Counselor Eric Yost.<br/><br/></p><p>Under pressure from Colyer and his campaign team, Kobach has recused himself from overseeing the election. He appointed Rucker, his employee and a supporter of his campaign, to act as chief election official in his place.</p><p>The ballots approved by the election board are now being counted by election office workers.</p><p>Many of those ballots will have to be counted by hand.</p><p>Results are expected to be reported at 10 a.m. Tuesday at the Historic Courthouse downtown.<br/><br/></p><p>While Sedgwick County has decided to count the disputed ballots from unaffiliated voters the state’s other major county decided not to. </p><p> <!-- %asset:216595325% --> </p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker apparently misspoke on the issue Monday morning, leading to confusion for the Colyer campaign and others about which ballots will be counted when Johnson County does its final vote tally Tuesday afternoon.<br/><br/></p><p>Metsker said 57 unaffiliated voters in Johnson County who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots would have their votes counted.</p><p>After the meeting, The Kansas City Star asked Metsker specifically whether this meant that voters who were told to cast provisional ballots without declaring a party would see their votes counted.</p><p>“That’s correct. We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied. “These are citizens. We train them. We train them hard. There were a number of problems at that location.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216610415% --></p><p>However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party.</p><p>“This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.”</p><p>But that doesn’t include the 35 other provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who did not mark a form to declare a party. Those votes will be disallowed.</p><p>The Johnson County election board voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations.</p><p>The board also voted to accept 275 ballots in part and to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons. </p><p>The Johnson County board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.<br/><br/></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"436\" style=\"width: 327pt;\"> <colgroup><col width=\"368\"

Jeff Colyer’s office as the feud between the two Republican candidates continues. </p><p>As county canvassing boards began to meet Monday to review provisional votes, Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker said in an email late Sunday that “there has been considerable public discussion regarding whether unaffiliated voters can participate in Kansas party primary elections.”</p><p>He then attached a series of legal instructions including that “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p><p>Under Kansas law, unaffiliated voters are able to declare a party at the polls, and then vote in that party’s primary. Kansas law does not allow for open Republican and Democratic primaries.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign late last week voiced concerns about unaffiliated voters who were incorrectly told by poll workers to cast provisional ballots.</p><p>The governor’s office argued in a legal opinion sent to The Star Monday morning that “Kansas law requires canvassers to look to the intent of the voter” in cases where a poll worker incorrectly tells an unaffiliated voter to cast a provisional ballot, rather than to affiliate and then vote.</p><p>“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Brant Laue, the chief legal counsel of the governor’s office, said in the letter.</p><p>Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, has a <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article216487350.html\" target=\"_self\">slim lead, 110 votes, over Colyer in the GOP primary for governor</a>. Roughly 9,000 provisional ballots are spread across the state’s 105 counties. More than 40 percent of those ballots come from Johnson and Sedgwick counties, where Kobach has appointed the top election officials.</p><p>After initially resisting calls that he recuse himself from duties overseeing the election, Kobach eventually recused himself last week and named Rucker.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign also has alleged that “many Colyer voters had difficulties finding his name on the ballot, were forced to vote on provisional ballots, or were turned away outright for unknown reasons.”<br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:216521210% --></p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Gov. Jeff Colyer’s campaign staff left Monday morning’s canvassing meeting in Johnson County with the belief that the state’s most populous county would be counting all unaffiliated voters who cast ballots in the primary for governor. </p><p>But it appears that Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker misspoke on the issue Monday morning, leading to confusion for the Colyer campaign and others about which ballots will be counted when Johnson County does its final vote tally Tuesday. </p><p>Metsker referred to questions about the status of unaffiliated voters who were wrongly told to cast provisional ballots at their polling places and said 57 unaffiliated voters in Johnson County who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots would have their votes counted. </p><p>After the meeting, The Star asked Metsker specifically whether this meant that voters who were told to cast provisional ballots instead of declaring a party would see their votes counted. </p><p>“That’s correct. We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied. “These are citizens. We train them. We train them hard. There were a number of problems at that location.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216610415% --> </p><p>However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party. </p><p> “This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.” </p><p>The distinction affects 35 other ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who did not declare a party and won’t have their ballots counted.</p><p>The Johnson County Board of Canvassers voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations. </p><p> The canvassing board, which is made up by the county’s commissioners, also voted to accept 275 ballots in part and to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons. The majority of voters who will only have their ballots partially counted went to the wrong polling place on Election Day. Their votes for all statewide races, such as the primary for governor, will count.</p><p>The board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign raised concerns last week that unaffiliated voters who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots would not have their votes counted.</p><p>Kansas law allows unaffiliated voters to declare a party on the day of the primary to vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary.</p><p>Assistant Kansas Secretary of State Eric Rucker issued a guidance late Sunday night saying that if “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p><p>Clay Barker, Colyer’s special assistant, took Metsker’s assurances at the Monday meeting as a sign that the county was not following Rucker’s guidance. </p><p>“It would appear to me that the county commissioners with counsel from their elections commissioner and legal counsel decided to ignore it and do what they’ve done in the past, which is count ballots because they show a poll worker’s mistake,” said Barker, an attorney who previously served as executive director of the Kansas Republican Party.</p><p>Kobach’s spokeswoman, Danedri Herbert, contacted The Star shortly after the meeting to dispute that all of these ballots were being accepted. </p><p>“I just think it’s important to understand the difference, because other counties are now trying to follow Johnson County’s lead,” Herbert said. </p><p>Ed Eilert, who chairs the canvassing board and the county commission, said that he believes the distinction between which unaffiliated voters would count and which would not was clear at the meeting. </p><p>Regarding the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t count Eilert said that those are mostly mail-in ballots, according to his notes. </p><p>“There’s a place on there if you’re unaffiliated to mark the party and they didn’t,” Eilert said. “That’s the difference between the two.” </p><p>The issue also came up during Sedgwick County’s canvassing meeting. That county’s canvassing board voted<a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\" target=\"_blank\"> to accept 14 ballots cast by unaffiliated voters </a>who did not check a box marking party affiliation. </p><p>Rucker called Sedgwick County to object about the inclusion of the ballots immediately after the county’s vote, arguing about their legality with Sedgwick County Counselor Eric Yost. </p><p>The dispute could wind up in court. </p><p>Brant Laue, Colyer’s chief counsel, argued in a letter Monday morning that Kansas law requires counties to accept ballots from unaffiliated voters regardless of whether the registration switch was completed. Colyer’s campaign pointed back to this letter when asked for a comment about the confusion in Johnson County. </p><p>“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Laue said in a letter on letterhead from the governor’s office.</p><p>The confusion for voters was scorned by Cille King, a co-president for the League of Women Voters of Kansas. </p><p>If poll workers instructed the voter wrong, “I don’t think the voter should be penalized,” King said.</p><p>Among the 898 votes that were thrown out Monday in Johnson County were four mail-in ballots that lacked a postmark or had an illegible postmark.</p><p>Kobach’s office advised counties that these types of ballots couldnot be counted last week, which prompted Colyer to call on the state’s chiefelection official to recuse himself from the process.</p><p>An additional 59 people will not have their votes counted because they did notprovide photo ID as required by Kansas law. And 272 people tried to vote in theother party’s primary. </p><p>One voter died after casting a ballot, which prompted the election office to recommend the vote be treated as invalid.</p><p>“We only had one of those. Thank God,” Metsker told the commissioners.</p><p><!-- %asset:216341105% --> </p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kansas Democrats are delighted by the continuing battle between Kris Kobach and Jeff Colyer in the Republican race for governor. The prolonged uncertainty over who will win the primary election effectively hands Democrats “buckets of free money,” they say.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Republican race for governor may remain undecided for weeks and potentially end in lawsuits. Democrats say the extended drama gives them a head start on fundraising and organizing going into the general election season.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“It’s as if the Republicans are handing us buckets and buckets of free money … it’s days their money isn’t being used to attack anybody,” said Chris Reeves, a Democratic national committeeman in Kansas.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans are downplaying the possibility the unresolved contest between Kobach and Colyer, the current governor, will ultimately harm them in November. But they acknowledge the standoff could slow fundraising on their side.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kansas Republican Party Chairman Kelly Arnold said the uncertainty about the nominee “makes it a little more difficult for the campaigns to raise money … until they know they’re the candidate.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“You’ve got a number of people … who kind of wait until after the primaries are over because they’re there to support our nominee,” Arnold said. “Many of them are still sitting on the sidelines waiting.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">On Friday, Kobach, the secretary of state, held a lead of 110 votes, according to his office. The margin will almost certainly change when county election officials begin sifting through provisional ballots Monday.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The final results may not be certified until Aug. 31. Recounts and litigation remain possible.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">“We want the Republicans to spend as much time as they need to while we’re out talking to voters about what the future looks like,” Kansas House Minority Leader Jim Ward, a Wichita Democrat, said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">State Sen. Laura Kelly easily won the Democratic nomination for governor on election night and transitioned into general election mode. She has said it doesn’t matter whether she ends up facing Colyer or Kobach.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“The longer the story is indecision, confusion, disunity on the Republican side, I think the better that is for Democrats,” said Ethan Corson, director of the Kansas Democratic Party.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans, on the other hand, are waiting for the vote counting process to finish.</p><p>Arnold called the unresolved race a “temporary obstacle” that the party will work around and said the situation won’t hurt Republicans.<br/><br/></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He said Republicans will begin attacking Kelly right away.<br/><br/></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“We kind of have campaign plan A and campaign plan A.1 depending on which candidate we have,” Arnold said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Political parties typically use the days following a primary to unite and mend relationships frayed during the primary campaign. Parties and campaigns also intensify outreach to donors and activists as they kick off the general election season.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But instead of unifying, tensions are rising between Kobach and Colyer, who became governor six months ago when Sam Brownback resigned.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Colyer on Thursday demanded Kobach recuse himself from providing advice to county election officers and said he had made statements on national TV that were inconsistent with Kansas law. Colyer also hinted at the possibility of litigation.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kobach said Friday afternoon in a letter to Colyer that he would recuse himself from overseeing vote counting but said the decision is symbolic because the counties count votes, not him. He named longtime deputy Eric Rucker to oversee the election in his stead, but the Colyer campaign said his appointment didn’t address their concerns about a conflict of interest.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kobach also said Colyer’s rhetoric risked undermining public confidence in the election process.</p><p><!-- %asset:216335185% --> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">An extended recount or legal process could damage Republicans if candidates become hostile toward each other, said Patrick Miller, a political scientist at the University of Kansas.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“That would cost them time and resources and any of that hostility that gets out in the media doesn’t help the eventual nominee. It doesn’t help heal the wounds that always occur with primaries,” Miller said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Given that Republican voters were sharply divided between Kobach and Colyer, Senate Vice President Jeff Longbine, an Emporia Republican, said Republicans must analyze the results to determine exactly what voters said and carry out a strategy based on that message.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“I think it’s extremely important at this point for the Republican Party to make sure that we are inclusive, that we are listening to everyone’s thoughts and ideas within the party and that we get that unification that we’re going to need to be successful in November,” Longbine said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite the current division, Miller said Republicans still have a built-in structural advantage over Democrats: independent Greg Orman. Miller predicts Orman will draw away Democratic voters.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orman, a Johnson County businessman, isn’t officially on the general election ballot yet. He turned in thousands of signatures Monday to secure a spot and is waiting on the secretary of state’s office to certify the signatures.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“(Republicans) can afford to have damaging events occur, or to nominate someone like Kobach who appears from the polling to be a weaker candidate than Colyer,” Miller said. “They can afford that because they have the opposition split.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orman has rejected the argument that he will only take votes from Democrats. He has said he will build a coalition of Democrats as well as Republicans and independents.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Asked Friday whether the current lack of a Republican nominee helps Orman, campaign spokesman Sam Edelen said that regardless of who the nominee is, “the choice voters will have in November will be clear”: between two career politicians or Orman, a businessman.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans say they’re ready to move on to the general election.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">At a GOP unity breakfast on Wednesday, House Majority Leader Don Hineman, R-Dighton, called on Republicans in all political races to come together.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“What we need to remember is what happened yesterday was an intramural scrimmage,” Hineman said. “What’s coming up is a varsity match.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>The Federal Election Commission is for the first time seriously considering banning members of Congress from using any political donations for personal use.</p><p>Its action was spurred by a report from watchdog groups that found “often under the guise of fundraising activity, officeholders and candidates overwhelmingly use leadership PAC money to pay for, among other things, five-star luxury resort stays, expensive dinners, trips to theme parks, golf outings, tickets to Broadway shows and sporting events, and international travel.”</p><p>Past use of leadership PACs that could come under review in the future if this became a rule include:<br/><br/></p><ul><li>Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, spending $15,000 on <a href=\"https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article215099780.html\" target=\"_blank\">Celtics tickets</a> in 2017.</li><li>Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, spending $11,000 at <a href=\"https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article215180860.html\" target=\"_blank\">restaurants in Italy and Malta</a> in 2017.</li><li>Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., spending nearly $40,000 between 2015 and 2018 on fundraising at Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando Resort.</li><li>Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, spending $111 on a hunting license in 2015.</li></ul><p>Kelsey Cooper, Paul communications director, said the senator’s expenses at restaurants were “a fundraising expense for events that made a large amount of money for RANDPAC.</p><p>“Every charity and political cause has fundraising expenses and to characterize them as anything else is a total lie,” Cooper said.<br/><br/></p><p>Nunes’ office has never denied his spending the money on Celtics tickets but complained about McClatchy’s repeated coverage of the issue when reached for comment Monday. Offices for Nelson and Cornyn did not return a request for comment.</p><p>Members of Congress typically have two accounts associated with them personally: Their campaign account and what is known as a leadership PAC. There is already a personal use ban on campaign accounts but not on leadership PACs.</p><p>If the FEC eventually approves the ban rule, it would treat leadership PAC spending as similar to campaign account spending, meaning much more scrutiny of leadership PAC expenses in the future.</p><p>Leadership PACs are purportedly meant for candidates to donate to other candidates and committees, but the report by Campaign Legal Center and Issue One, nonpartisan watchdog agencies, found candidates only used an average of 45 percent of leadership PAC funds for that purpose over the last three election cycles.</p><p>“In order to drain the swamp in Washington, cleaning up leadership PAC spending is a good way to start,” said Brendan Fischer, director of the Federal Reform Program at Campaign Legal Center.</p><p>The FEC posted a <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/17/2018-20095/rulemaking-petition-personal-use-of-leadership-pac-funds\" target=\"_blank\">call for public comment</a> on the proposed rule Monday and gave 60 days for comment, the first step to possibly adding the rule. It would take effect after the 2018 elections and not be retroactive, meaning past spending would be free from FEC penalty.</p><p>The FEC considers purchases for entertainment, household food items, clothing, funeral expenses, tuition payments, investment expenses, salary payments to a family member and dues or fees to places such as country clubs as <a href=\"https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/making-disbursements/personal-use/\" target=\"_blank\">automatic personal uses</a>. Other uses, such as meals, travel, vehicle or legal expenses are considered on a case-by-case basis.</p><p> <!-- %asset:159747959% --> </p><p>The commission can only impose civil penalties, such as warnings and fines, but it can also submit information to the Department of Justice if it feels the spending rises to the level of criminal abuse. The FEC is not able to initiate removal from public office.</p><p>Campaign Legal Center, Issue One, and five former United States representatives submitted a request to the FEC on July 24 to consider the rule. Fischer said he was not surprised the commission set up public comment on the rule but saw a long path to approval.</p><p>There are currently two Republicans, one Democrat and one Independent member on the commission. There are supposed to be six commission members, and FEC regulations mandate that four affirmative votes — a majority when the commission is fully staffed — are necessary to move a rule forward.</p><p>“Republican members have been reticent in the past to take action on these types of rules,” Fischer said. “We’re hoping the research in the report we submitted will change that.”</p><p>This is the first time the FEC has considered such a rule on leadership PACs. Only one or two items tend to go through this process every year, according to Judy Ingram, a spokeswoman for the FEC. </p><p>That doesn’t mean approval is assured, and it’s also unclear how long the process will take. There can be multiple hearings after the comment period, each requiring a vote forward by the commission.</p><p>“It’s not a short process by any means,” Ingram said. </p><p>Ingram said the FEC has recommended prohibiting personal use by all campaign committees in the past to Congress but now the consideration by the FEC is being driven by the request by Campaign Legal Center and others.</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\">Kate Irby: 202-383-6071; @KateIrby</div></div>",

              "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>A Republican in Washington state faces a tough House race against her Democratic challenger. If Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler loses, the GOP could be left with no Hispanic women in Congress.</p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, one of the GOP’s three Hispanic congresswomen — and one of its rising stars<b> </b>— is at risk of losing her re-election campaign.</p><p>After trouncing her 2016 Democratic opponent in Washington’s 3rd Congressional District by more than 20 percentage points, Herrera Beutler is facing a tougher-than-expected opponent in Carolyn Long,<b> </b>a Democrat<b> </b>who finished within seven percentage points of Herrera Beutler in the state’s August primary.</p><p>Herrera Beutler, first elected to the House of Representatives in 2010, is one of two Hispanic Republican women who can vote in Congress. A third, Jenniffer González-Colón, represents Puerto Rico and does not have a vote. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, the first Hispanic woman to ever serve in Congress, is retiring.</p><p>Herrera Beutler, running in a district won by Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, is in danger, as fired-up voters and President Donald Trump’s low approval ratings buoy Democratic candidates’ chances nationwide.</p><p>After the Washington state primary, <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2018-ratings-changes/#house\" target=\"_self\">Sabato’s Crystal Ball</a>, a nonpartisan site that rates congressional races, changed the race from “safe Republican” to “leans Republican,” one step away from a toss-up. Kyle Kondik, the site’s managing editor, predicts a “pretty close race” in the general election.</p><p>“There are going to be Republican incumbents who feel the heat in this election in ways they haven’t” in years past, Kondik said. “That really just has to do with the national environment.” Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats to win control of the House.</p><p>Kondik did not see the seat as a key target for Democrats heading into the election year, but now said the party can be emboldened because the combined vote for Democratic candidates in the primary was about 49 percent. That surprising statistic points to high Democratic enthusiasm, he said, and the question heading into the general election is whether that energy will be maintained.</p><p>“I think it probably will, but maybe Republicans will catch up a little bit,” he said.</p><p>Long’s strong showing prompted the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to add her to its <a href=\"https://redtoblue.dccc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Red to Blue</a> program, which “arms top-tier candidates with organizational and fundraising support to help them continue to run strong campaigns.”</p><p><!-- %asset:218274985% --></p><p>The DCCC has not yet spent money on Long’s race, and DCCC spokeswoman Amanda Sherman would not say why, or provide specifics on funding decisions.</p><p>The DCCC is “making all funding decisions on a rolling basis right now,” she said.</p><p>Long, an associate professor of political science at Washington State University Vancouver, said the Red to Blue involvement was “signaling to donors nationally that this is competitive.” She’s since seen some out-of-state donations.</p><p>Long was also endorsed by <a href=\"https://www.emilyslist.org/\" target=\"_blank\">EMILY’s List</a>, a political action committee that works to elect pro-choice women. She said she’s not relying completely on such support.</p><p>“I’m not counting on a blue wave. I’m counting on a Carolyn Long wave,” she said. “To hope that the generic ballot and hope that Trump’s popularity gets you across the finish line is a very small part of the story.”<br/><br/></p><p> <!-- %asset:149640679% --> </p><p>Herrera Beutler thinks her hometown story — she’s a native of the area — and focus on local issues, such as unemployment and the economy, will resonate with voters, even in a tough national environment for Republicans.</p><p>“(National issues are) definitely something my opponent is using to her advantage,” Herrera Beutler said. “But if we’re actually talking about issues here that are specific to this region, I feel like it is much more where people’s hearts and minds are at.”</p><p>As one of the few Hispanic Republican women in Congress, Herrera Beutler said she brings up issues others might not consider.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Being a young mom, being a Hispanic, that adds a perspective that I think my party needs at the table, quite frankly,” she said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For instance, in 2016, she <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/fda-to-allow-folic-acid-in-corn-masa-to-stop-birth-defects/\" target=\"_blank\">led an effort</a> to convince the Food and Drug Administration to counter serious birth defects by allowing folic acid to be added to corn flour masa, a staple in Hispanic communities. The FDA had already been enriching wheat and rice flours for decades.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, R-Fla., chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Conference, said he would “never bet against” Herrera Beutler.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I believe that her worth is not because she’s a woman, not because she’s a Latina, (but) because she’s very talented and works hard,” he said, adding that she has a reputation for being willing to reach across the aisle to work with Democrats.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Georgetown University’s <a href=\"http://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lugar Center</a>, which tracks bipartisanship, listed Herrera Beutler as the 15th most bipartisan representative in the House in 2017, and <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/house/\" target=\"_blank\">FiveThirtyEight’s Trump Score</a> tracker shows she votes in line with the president’s position 91 percent of the time, less often than about 180 of her colleagues. But she also <a href=\"https://www.columbian.com/news/2018/jun/27/trump-urges-house-gop-to-back-immigration-bill/\" target=\"_blank\">drew headlines in Washington</a> for supporting a failed border wall funding bill in June that nearly half of the House Republicans opposed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Even if Long wins, there’s a chance the GOP will elect other Hispanic women this fall. Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce CEO Lea Márquez Peterson is battling former Arizona Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, a Democrat, for Arizona’s 2nd Congressional District seat, which Sabato’s Crystal Ball says “leans Democratic.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Márquez Peterson is “going to bring some of that same female Hispanic, Latina perspective to the table,” Herrera Beutler said. “So I am looking forward to the reinforcements.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In Florida, Cuban-American television journalist Maria Salazar, a Republican, is vying with Democrat Donna Shalala, a former Clinton administration Health and Human Services Secretary, for Ros-Lehtinen’s seat.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sabato’s Crystal Ball lists that district as “leans Democratic” as well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Ros-Lehtinen disagreed. “Pundits say that my race is over because Hillary Clinton won (the district) by 20 points,” she said. “However, those pundits have not met Maria Elvira Salazar. She is a firebrand, she’s poised, she’s intelligent. She’s telegenic, she knows the issues, and I think they will change their calculations soon.”</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"><i>Kellen Browning, 202-383-6102, @kellen_browning</i></div></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Blindsided by an accusation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, conservative groups still pushing for his confirmation had a message Monday: Let’s hear from the accuser.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Obviously Ms. Ford’s allegations are serious and should be heard,” said Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony List, which has been organizing in states with key 2018 contests to push Kavanaugh’s confirmation. “Judge Kavanaugh should also have an opportunity to respond. This should be done as quickly as possible so that the vote can continue without delay.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Still, she said, “We have no reason to change our support for Judge Kavanaugh.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On Sunday, the Washington Post published<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/california-professor-writer-of-confidential-brett-kavanaugh-letter-speaks-out-about-her-allegation-of-sexual-assault/2018/09/16/46982194-b846-11e8-94eb-3bd52dfe917b_story.html?utm_term=.fe88e18f699c\"> an interview</a> with a California-based professor who went public with her allegation that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at a party in high school. The professor, Christine Blasey Ford, had previously raised this concern privately to California lawmakers, but after details of the allegation began to leak out—and Kavanaugh’s allies dismissed the claims as baseless and anonymous—she came forward to share her perspective.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The development has thrown the trajectory of his confirmation into doubt, two weeks before the next Supreme Court session and 50 days before Election Day. The allegation from Ford escalates an already-contentious confirmation process that has included heated hearings, drama over Democratic efforts to release previously confidential documents and controversy over Kavanaugh’s views on abortion and birth control.</p><p>Ford is willing to testify in the Senate, her lawyer said Monday. Kavanaugh said in his own statement that he is “willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the Committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“This woman should not be insulted and she should not be ignored,” Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Donald Trump, said on Fox News on Monday, setting the tone for other conservatives who indicated openness to hearing from Ford.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Conway added that Kavanaugh “is a man of character and integrity” and “it should not unduly delay the vote on Judge Kavanaugh.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kavanaugh’s backers—who say they are suspicious of the timing surrounding the surfacing of the allegation—want to confirm the judge by the time the Supreme Court opens for its October session, ahead of Election Day. In interviews Monday, several of them said Ford should be allowed to speak, but urged that she do so as quickly as possible so that the confirmation process could move forward, a sign that they remain strongly in Kavanaugh’s corner.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I don’t see any reason to delay this process,” said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a socially conservative organization. “We now have an allegation, unsubstantiated, 36 years old, but we have a name associated with it now. If this is not a delay tactic, if this is genuine, then let’s go ahead and hear from the accuser, let’s hear the judge’s response. If there’s any additional witnesses that need to be talked to, either by the FBI or committee staff, we can do that.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“We think all of that can occur, and it can do so without unduly delaying the Senate advising and consenting to this nomination,” he added, saying that he deferred to the GOP leadership of the Judiciary Committee on the best way to proceed. “We continue to believe that can and should happen before the October session of the Supreme Court begins.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee has been slated for Thursday, though several Republican senators have now said that the committee should hear from Ford. All 10 Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-call-to-delay-scotus-nominee-brett-kavanaugh-committee-vote-christine-blasey-ford-assault-accuser/\"> have signed</a> a letter asking for a delay on the vote.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“She should have a platform to discuss the issues,” said Tony Perkins, the head of the Family Research Council, another prominent socially conservative organization. But, he added, “Everyone should be able to bring forth any issues, but I don’t think it should be allowed to derail the process that’s in place.”</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\">Katie Glueck: 202-286-2392, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katieglueck\">@katieglueck</a></div></div>",

Claire McCaskill and Roy Blunt —<b> </b>usually on opposite political sides — offered nearly identical reactions to the sexual assault allegations against federal Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a sign of the high political stakes for both GOP leaders and red state Democrats as the Senate weighs the judge’s nomination to the Supreme Court. </p><p>Blunt,<b> </b>a member of Senate leadership, has given full-throated support to Kavanaugh’s nomination. But in a statement Monday, the Missouri Republican called for the Senate to slow the process to look into allegations Kavanaugh sexually assaulted a peer as a teenager.</p><p>“These are serious allegations that need to be looked at closely by the committee before any other action is taken,” Blunt said.</p><p>McCaskill has been closely scrutinized by both sides of the aisle for how she’ll vote on President Donald Trump’s nominee as she runs for re-election in a state Trump won by double digits. The Missouri Democrat has been <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article214570885.html\" target=\"_blank\">attacked by both conservatives</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article218009020.html\" target=\"_blank\">progressives for not taking a firm stance </a>on the judge’s nomination to the high court.</p><p>“I am deeply troubled by these allegations. They should be examined thoroughly and fairly by the Judiciary Committee without any artificial timeline,” said McCaskill, who has spent years advocating for legislation to combat sexual assault on college campuses, in the military and at government agencies. </p><p>In a July letter, Christine Blasey Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University in California, accused President Donald Trump’s nominee to the court of physically and sexually assaulting her when they were both high school students in the 1980s.</p><p>Kavanaugh has denied the allegations, which became public last week after the letter was letter was disclosed last week by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California.</p><p>McCaskill’s GOP opponent, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, said in a statement late Monday that he was concerned that “Feinstein and the Democrats waited until the last hour to bring this 30-year old allegation to light. The Democrats have played politics with this entire process and were opposed to Brett Kavanaugh before he was even nominated. They don’t care about the truth.”</p><p>However, Hawley, the state’s top law enforcement official, also said that he believes “allegations of sexual misconduct should never be disregarded. That’s why it’s important that both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh be heard immediately and under oath.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:218548135% --> </p><p>The Trump-endorsed Republican<b> </b>initially<b> </b>dodged a question about the allegations against Kavanaugh after Friday’s Senate debate in St. Louis. <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article208651959.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hawley previously urged former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens to resign</a> earlier this year in the face of allegations of sexual violence.</p><p>Before the allegations against Kavanaugh became public, Blunt touted Kavanaugh’s personal background in a speech on the Senate floor earlier this month and criticized Democratic efforts to slow his nomination.</p><p>“He’s a church volunteer, mentoring people at schools. He has been widely supported by those who have dealt with him, his classmates, his colleagues, his clerks, lawyers, legal scholars,” Blunt said at the time.</p><p>Trump Monday accepted the possibility that a vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination would be delayed.</p><p>“If it takes a little delay, it’ll take a little delay. It shouldn’t certainly be very much. But again, this is something that should have been brought up long before this. They had the information in July as I understand it. That’s a long time ago and nobody mentioned it until the other day,” Trump said, according to a White House pool report. </p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">The Kansas City Star’s Steve Vockrodt contributed to this report. </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">Bryan Lowry: 202-383-6167, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BryanLowry3\">@BryanLowry3</a></p></div><p> <!-- %asset:214857220% --> </p></div>",

Here’s what they had to say. </p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">It’s been a little more than three years since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage, and the <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article218257110.html#cardLink=row1_card1\" target=\"_self\">debate over LGBTQ rights in Missouri</a> is ongoing. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Star’s readers wanted to know: Should Missouri state law protect LGBTQ people from discrimination at work, in housing decisions and at private businesses?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Plus, we asked: What do you think the biggest barrier is in Missouri to extending such protections?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Here’s how members of the Star’s Missouri Influencer panel answered those questions. Most favored protections for LGBTQ people.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Kay Barnes, former mayor of Kansas City, senior director for university engagement at Park University:</b> <span>“Yes.”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The barrier: </span>Lack of understanding and thus discrimination against members of the LGBT community.</p><p><b>Michael Barrett, Missouri State Public Defender director:</b> “Rationale for denying someone a basic need, whether it be a home, a job, or health care should be based on criteria that can be applied across the board and does not target classes of persons. Quite simply, it should not be legal to deprive someone of such a need based on the way they look, worship, or love.”</p><p>The barrier: “fear of excessive lawsuits.” </p><p><b>Brenda Bethman, director of UMKC Women’s Center:</b> “Yes, there needs to be state-level (ideally federal) protections in place — otherwise LGBTQ people will continue to face legal discrimination.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: Anti-LGBTQ prejudice is the biggest barrier.</p><p><b>Mark Bryant, attorney and former Kansas City Council member:</b> “It is unfortunate but Missouri law needs to protect LGBTQ people at work, in housing decisions and at private businesses. Otherwise, LGBTQ people will be subject to the same types of discrimination that persons of African-American, Mexican and foreign national descent suffer. The United States is great because it absorbs different people from different places and blends culture(s) into something new. LGBTQ people are talented and innovative. We should prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.”</p><p>The barrier: “Survey polls do not indicate broad support in Missouri for laws which prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.”</p><p><b>Mike Burke, attorney and former Kansas City Council member:</b> “The short answer is yes. Missouri needs to enter the 21st Century in its laws on discrimination. A nondiscrimination law on a statewide level would send a message nationally that we are a tolerant society. Our cities have already taken a lead on nondiscrimination but without state legislation we are behind the times.”</p><p>The barrier: “We have too many legislators who feel they need to play to the lowest denominator in their base rather than the population as a whole.”</p><p><b>Thomas Curran, president of Rockhurst University:</b> “The promotion of human dignity and the pursuit of the common good compels us to have laws in the state of Missouri that protect all people from discrimination at work, in matters of housing and in private business. When this is not the practice, we need to create laws that specifically protect any and all groups who have experienced discrimination in these matters.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Tragically, we come across circumstances and situations where the promotion and preservation of human dignity has not been practiced because it’s not believed that we are all created equal.”</p><p><b>Jack Danforth, former U.S. senator:</b> “<span>I think that people should be protected from discrimination based on sexual orientation, except I think that the law should allow for businesses and organizations to practice their religious beliefs when their religion does not recognize same-sex marriage.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Until very recently, most people had never heard of same-sex marriage, and could not imagine that it could exist. This has changed dramatically over a very few years as more and more people, especially young people, take same sex marriage for granted. As the years pass, there will be increasingly less opposition to it.”</span></p><p><b>Reza Derakhshani, UMKC associate professor of computer science and electrical engineering:</b> “Yes.” </p><p>The barrier: “Bitter and and emotionally charged partisan rivalries, catering to unfounded fears rather than evidence-based research.”</p><p><b>Jane Dueker, lawyer, radio host and former political adviser:</b> “Absolutely.”</p><p><span>The barrier: “I think there are religious objections from lawmakers. Some business groups object citing the creation of new lawsuits. Similar to gay marriage, I think the legislature will punt and force the courts to do the right thing and then say ‘it is settled.’”</span></p><p><b>Gwen Grant, Urban League of Greater Kansas City: </b>“Yes. These people should be added as a protected class in Missouri law, which should include language specific to sexual orientation and gender identity.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span>The barrier: “We’re a conservative state and the legislature reflects it.”</span></p><p><b>Jason Grill, media, public affairs and crisis communications consultant:</b> “<span>No individual should face discrimination at work or in their job in any case no matter race, creed, religion or sexual orientation.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Current political makeup and numbers in the Missouri General Assembly, as well as some viewpoints that private businesses can do what they choose and should not be regulated in this manner by the government.”</span></p><p><b>John Hancock, former chairman of Missouri Republican Party: </b>“<span>Nobody should be for discrimination.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Two potential hurdles: One is the need to respect religious conscience. The second is a reluctance to increase the amount of litigation.”</span></p><p><b>Deb Hermann, CEO of Northland Neighborhoods, Inc.: </b>“Yes.”</p><p>The barrier: “The House passed HB2100 last session — a good step. However, I am unsure of the governor’s action on this legislation. It needs to be approved. Ignorance inflamed by political rhetoric causes great damage to this cause.”</p><p><b>Bob Holden, former governor:</b> “Yes. If we want to achieve our best economic and social status we must become more inclusive.”</p><p>The barrier: “Lack of understanding and in some cases awareness.”</p><p><b>Sly James, mayor of Kansas City:</b> “Missouri law should protect all people from discrimination and in the decisions and circumstances that affect their lives. Neither the Bill of Rights, nor the Constitution of either the United States or the State of Missouri include the phrase ‘unless you are gay’ in the texts. Our history should be enough to remind us that discrimination comes to no good end.”</p><p>The barrier: “Political ideologies that pander to a group of citizens who, for religious or other reasons, do not see the LGBTQ community as complete and equal humans. The ideologies tend to view this segment of the electorate as a voting block to be pursued and won.”</p><p><b>Jolie Justus, Kansas City councilwoman:</b> “Yes.” </p><p>The barrier: “Leadership in the Missouri House and Senate and the Missouri Chamber of Commerce”</p><p><b>Gregg Keller, principal of Atlas Strategy Group:</b> “This is a worthwhile discussion to have as soon as, but not before, the political left settles upon a definition of gender identity that goes beyond how a given individual feels they ‘identify’ on any given day.”</p><p>The barrier: “The political left coming up with a coherent definition of the terms involved.”</p><p><b>Crosby Kemper III, director of the Kansas City Public Library, co-founder of the Show-Me Institute:</b> “As an employer in more than one field in my career, I have always been interested in hiring the best people regardless of what goes on in their private lives (if legal and not disturbing to the institutions’ customers or colleagues). I would resist adding special classes of protection beyond all the already powerful anti-discrimination laws. That said I’m open to evidence that such discrimination is a serious problem which needs legal redress.”</p><p><span>The barrier: “See above.”</span></p><p><b>Jennifer Lowry, chief toxicologist at Children’s Mercy Hospital:</b> “Absolutely! It is unfathomable to me that in 2018 we continue to have this conversation. All people deserve to work. All people deserve to have a home. All people deserve to walk into a business and be treated the same as any other person. Sex and gender of an individual is not a public discussion. It is personal to that individual and should not be judged by others. Those businesses who have employment opportunities should hire a person based on their ability to perform the job. Those who have housing to rent or sell should be proud that any person wants to live in that home. Those who have businesses that want to make a living should be happy to sell their product to those who want to enter their establishment. If we agree that sex and gender are protected, then so should the community that wears it proudly.”<br/><br/></p><p><span>The barrier: “The largest barrier to extending protections to the LGBTQ community are those who use religion to justify actions against those that make them uncomfortable. However, our constitution requires the separation of church and state and, thus, religion cannot be used as a basis for establishing law. Most importantly, however, most religious teachings, if the constitution allowed it to be considered, would promote kindness and love over hate and fear.”</span></p><p><b>Quinton Lucas, Kansas City Council member:</b> “<span>It’s unconscionable that Missouri law does not already protect LGBTQ persons from discrimination at work, in housing, and in private business. We should join the rest of the country and give our citizens all rights.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Bigotry remains our biggest barrier to extending rights to all persons.”</span></p><p><b>Dianne Lynch, president of Stephens College:</b> “Missouri needs the most talented, innovative and committed workforce it can attract and retain if it’s going to be competitive. That means it needs to be as inclusive and respectful of individual and privacy rights as the markets with which it is competing for talent. This isn’t a personal values question; it’s a business decision. So the answer in the best interests of all Missourians is: Yes. Absolutely. Without a doubt.”</p><p>The barrier: “There’s a blurring of the lines between personal values and beliefs, and economic analyses about what is likely to best serve all Missourians. Our leaders can respect the personal beliefs of all constituents and still support legislation that expands the state’s talent pool, markets and partnerships with those who don’t share those beliefs.”</p><p><b>Christopher Maples, interim chancellor of the Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology:</b> “Missouri state law should protect LGBTQ people from discrimination at work, in housing decisions, and at private businesses.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “The biggest barrier to Missouri extending protections to LGBTQ people may be the reticence of elected officials to introduce legislation that may be viewed as being in opposition to religious views held by some of their constituents.”</p><p><b>Richard Martin, director of governmental affairs at JE Dunn Construction:</b> “If there is not current law that protects the LGBTQ community from discrimination in housing, employment and their freedom to pursue economic opportunities without obstacles based on their sexual identity. Then yes.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Perhaps it’s in the state’s DNA to be more like a follower than a leader on progressive social issues.”</p><p><b>Jay Nixon, former governor:</b> “<span>Absolutely. Our state must lead on vital civil rights issues, and be a welcoming place to work and live.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “The major business interests and groups must prioritize this as ‘workforce’ development.”</span></p><p><b>Ken Novak, UMKC professor of criminal justice and criminology:</b> “State law should protect the LGBTQ community from discriminatory practices at work and other forums. LGBTQ is a protected class and citizens should expect the same legal protection from discriminatory behavior as gender, race, ethnicity, age, veteran status, etc. But beyond the legal implications — it’s just the right thing to do. That should be sufficient justification alone.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Like many protected classes the LGBTQ community comprises a small portion of the population — clearly the minority. Legislators, as well as citizens, likely have less familiarity with people in this community or the unique barriers they face, and, as such, (don’t prioritize) safeguards to mitigate discriminatory practices. Protection may be triaged as a lower priority (if it is a priority at all).”</p><p><b>CiCi Rojas, partner and president of Tico Productions and Tico Sports:</b> “In general, yes.” </p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Businesses or organizations who may have religious or bias that prohibit them.”</p><p><b>Leland Shurin, attorney, vice president Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners:</b> “Absolutely. I am amazed, disappointed and angered that it would still be a question/issue in Missouri at this time.”</p><p>The barrier: “The use by so many politicians of unreasonable fear as a political wedge issue and the erroneous interpretation of religious principles.”</p><p><b>Ryan Silvey, Missouri Public Service commissioner, former state senator: </b>“<span>Yes”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “There is a philosophical concern by several in the legislature with creating additional protected classes for any reason.”</span></p><p><b>Jeff Simon, managing partner, Husch Blackwell:</b> “Yes.” </p><p><span>The barrier: “A philosophical concern about over-regulation by government, combined with a lingering prejudice against gays among some.”</span></p><p><b>Phil Snowden, member of University of Missouri Board of Curators: </b>“<span>Yes. Yes. We’re all people and all in this together. We should have equal rights.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Sometimes movements take shape and the right course of action doesn’t evolve for years. This may not be the hottest issue to push in Missouri but the state is headed in the right direction.”</span></p><p><b>David Steelman, attorney, former state legislator, chairman of the University of Missouri Board of Curators:</b> “Yes.” </p><p>The barrier: “All reasonable people should agree that discrimination is wrong and should be discouraged. However, the details of the remedy are always more important than is realized. It is important the legislation not be unduly restrictive of religious freedom or freedom of association.”</p><p><b>Maurice Watson, partner at Husch Blackwell law firm: </b>“<span>Protections in Missouri are needed and overdue.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “There’s hope in the tolerant attitudes of younger people who are now of voting age.”</span></p><p><b>Pam Whiting, vice president for communications, Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce:</b> “<span>Absolutely.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: While attitudes and understanding continue to evolve, we still have a long way to go. SJR 39 came close to passage two years ago, but was narrowly defeated, which gives me hope, though similar bills have been introduced in the legislature the past two years. Thankfully, they didn’t go anywhere.</span></p></div>",

Asked about LGBTQ issues, readers in an online survey rated as their top question whether the state should extend legal protections to LGBTQ people at work, in housing decisions and in private businesses.</p><p>Of more than <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article218408650.html#storylink=mainstage\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">30 Influencers who weighed in on that question</a>, many allowed that difficult but realistic challenges stir in the details. </p><p>Who prevails, for example, when someone’s sexual orientation clashes with the biblical beliefs of a faith-based employer or adoption agency, wedding planner, university or service providers to the aged?</p><p>Or, how should society settle tensions that arise when schools provide special restroom privileges for pupils transitioning to the gender with which they identify?</p><p>That riddle is now being weighed by the Missouri Supreme Court, which could rule by Election Day on <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article209799884.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a locker room dispute in the Blue Springs School District.</a></p><p>The primary beachheads in Missouri and much of the nation are courtrooms considering, case by case, matters pitting religious liberties, personal privacy and the meaning of equal protection. </p><p>In a yet another case being mulled by the Missouri Supreme Court, a gay man working for the state Department of Social Services said he was treated poorly because he lacked “stereotypical attributes of how a male should appear and behave.” Missouri’s Human Rights Commission rejected his case after ruling that the worker was claiming discrimination on sexual orientation rather than on his sex, or gender, and thus he was not in a protected class under state law. </p><p>An appeals court ruled in the man’s favor and the state appealed.</p><p>“There are still many people not there with us,” said Kansas City Councilwoman Jolie Justus.</p><p>She was the first openly gay person to win a state Senate seat 12 years ago. </p><p>Despite enormous strides in LGBTQ acceptance since then, Justus said, Missourians in many communities can still be fired for setting on their office desk a portrait of a same-sex spouse.</p><h3>Equal protection</h3><p>Sharpest on the radar of gay-rights issues in Missouri is potential passage of a bill that would protect what groups increasingly call “LGBTQ” persons from discrimination in employment and housing.</p><p>(Just this summer the St. Louis-based advocacy group<a href=\"https://promoonline.org/news/we-are-adding-the-q/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> PROMO added to the LGBT designation the letter “Q”</a> , for queer, signifying a proud stance of many in the movement, especially millennials, to project more inclusive lifestyles over specific categories of sexuality.)</p><p>Regarding job discrimination, push-back groups include the Associated Industries of Missouri, representing hundreds of companies. Ray McCarty, the group’s president and CEO, told The Star, “We oppose legislation that sets up new ways of suing employers.”</p><p>The concern over creating grounds for too many lawsuits is expressed by some Kansas City area Influencers, as well. </p><p>“I would resist adding special classes of protection beyond the already powerful anti-discrimination laws,” said Crosby Kemper III, director of the Kansas City Public Library. “That said, I’m open to evidence that such discrimination is a serious problem which needs legal redress.”</p><p>Missouri House Rep. Greg Razer, a Kansas City Democrat, is trying. He said he and a Republican colleague — the only openly gay members of the legislature — are encountering growing support from legislators to approve LGBTQ protections after 20 years of dodging the Missouri Nondiscrimination Act.</p><p>In May, Razer’s bill <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article211342324.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">won 6-0 approval from a state legislative committee</a> — just the second time a committee cleared a MONA measure since the movement took off. “That’s as far as we got,” Razer said. “And sadly, that was a victory.”</p><p>But he expressed confidence that anti-discrimination forces finally have enough backing from Missouri lawmakers — including many older Republicans once opposed — that a resubmitted bill may quickly become law after legislators convene in January.</p><p>“I feel like at any moment the floodgate on this issue is going to open,” Razer said. </p><p>He noted that <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article212688674.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, voted as a state senator</a> in 2013 for one version of the Missouri Nondiscrimination Act. </p><p>No such measure became law this year, as legislative leaders who have come around on MONA were cautious not to rile conservative voter bases in 2018 elections. But Razer said that he has heard enough support from both sides of the political aisle that passage is closer than ever before.</p><p>John Hancock, a political consultant who for many years headed the Missouri GOP, agreed.</p><p>With conditions.</p><p>“If it’s written narrowly enough” so as not to impose on the rights on faith-based employers who might “object out of conscience,” then many conservatives will support the legislation, Hancock said.</p><p> “As a matter of general principle,” he added, “nobody should be for discrimination.”</p><p>Kansas City, Jackson and St. Louis counties and a dozen other Missouri cities have local ordinances that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. But for LGBTQ persons facing unfair treatment at work or in obtaining housing, “to use just a city law to get the protections they need isn’t enough,” Justus said. </p><p>She said it’s time for the state to extend protections it has long carved into law for classes of race, age, religion, sex and the disabled. </p><h3>Schools and gender ID</h3><p>On another front, Missouri public school districts are quickly confronting, one by one, a push in some communities for “gender-neutral” bathrooms.</p><p>When classes opened last month in the North Kansas City School District, students and parents seemed to welcome fully enclosed <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article216439305.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">single-occupancy stalls</a> at two new grade schools, two sixth-grade centers and North Kansas City High School. Signage on the rooms feature male and female figures, providing private and more comfortable accommodations for students regardless of their gender identity, school officials told The Star.</p><p>In Blue Springs, a legal showdown ensued in 2016 when school administrators denied a transgender student’s request to use male locker room facilities. </p><p>Attorneys for the teen — identified as “RMA” in court documents — argue the pupil was discriminated against on sex-based grounds, a violation of the Missouri Human Rights Act. The school district counters that the law’s definition of “sex” doesn’t apply to RMA’s request. </p><p>A Jackson County judge and the Missouri Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the district. A state supreme court decision is expected in the fall.</p><p>Across Missouri, “we’ve had school districts quietly working with transgender students for a while, and nobody’s even noticed,” said Kelli Hopkins, associate executive director for the Missouri School Board Association. “Most district don’t draw a line until it comes to locker rooms and bathrooms.</p><p>“As cases are going up through the courts, you’re getting different results...We recommend that (schools) do whatever you can to accommodate all students.”</p><p>Transgender accommodations, in schools and the workplace, will continue to evolve, said attorney Maurice Watson, who heads a diversity and inclusion committee at the Husch Blackwell law firm.</p><p>Watson, an Influencer, said he has sat in meetings with local corporations attended by prominent transgender employees young and old.</p><p>“They may not be on the corporate board, but these are people in visible positions at their firms,” Watson said. “They are present and they are proud.” </p><h3>Religious freedoms</h3><p>Many of The Star’s Influencers referenced a need to respect religious freedoms while affirming LGBTQ rights and legal protections.</p><p>Former U.S. Sen. Jack Danforth: “I think that people should be protected from discrimination based on sexual orientation, except I think that the law should allow for businesses and organizations to practice their religious beliefs when their religion does not recognize same-sex marriage.”</p><p>Former state legislator David Steelman, chairman of the University of Missouri Board of Curators: “All reasonable people should agree that discrimination is wrong and should be discouraged. </p><p>“However, the details of the remedy are always more important than is realized. It is important the legislation not be unduly restrictive of religious freedom or freedom of association.”</p><p>Lawyer and radio host Jane Dueker questioned whether the statehouse ever will agree on a resolution: “Similar to gay marriage, I think the legislature will punt and force the courts to do the right thing then say, ‘it is settled.’”</p><p>Wouldn’t be a first for Jefferson City. </p><p>“Perhaps it’s in the state’s DNA,” said Influencer Richard Martin, of JE Dunn Construction, “to be more like a follower than a leader on progressive issues.”</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"><p>The Star’s Allison Kite contributed this report.</p></div><p>Previous survey: <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article217982680.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Organized labor</a></p><p>Next survey: Minimum wage</p><h3>We want to hear from you</h3><p>Initiative petitions have put minimum wage hikes on ballots across the country in recent years, and this year, Missourians will vote this fall on whether to raise the minimum rate to $12 per hour.

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Down in the polls, short on cash, and running out of time, Republican conservative firebrand Chris McDaniel says he’s far from cooked in his bid to win a U.S. Senate seat from Mississippi that he believes was stolen from him four years ago.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But polls say otherwise.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“When I first ran four years ago, what did the establishment say? ‘Not a chance, he may get 15 percent of the vote, his political career is over.’ Didn’t happen,” McDaniel said. “We were one of the first ‘Drain the Swamp’ candidates. We’re going to be fine.”</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>McDaniel’s 2018 campaign has seen a dramatic reversal of fortune from the 2014 Senate run that made him a tea party darling, garnered national attention, branded him as a conservative star on the rise, and shook the Republican Party establishment to its core.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“For some reason, though, the fire hasn’t started burning very brightly for Chris’ campaign this time,” said Marty Wiseman, former director of the John C. Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University. “It’s kind of left him sitting dead in the water.”</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Polls indicate that McDaniel is running a distant third in the Nov. 6 special election to replace Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Mississippi, who retired in April citing health reasons.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>If he, Republican </span><a href=\"https://cindyhydesmith.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith</a><span> or Democrat </span><a href=\"https://espyforsenate.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Espy</a><span>, a former U.S. House member and Clinton administration agriculture secretary, fail to win more than 50 percent of the vote in the so-called “jungle” election, the top two finishers will face each other in a Nov. 27 runoff.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>McDaniel says part of his campaign’s struggles are rooted in Republican Party success</span><span>. Barack Obama is out of the White House and Donald Trump is in. The GOP controls the Senate and the House of Representatives, regulations are being rolled back, and conservative judges are being nominated and confirmed.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“You still have the (voter) anger, but there is also a degree of satisfaction among some percentage of the base,” McDaniel said in an interview in his Laurel, Miss., law office. “They feel like things are in order, the structure is good against, that things are improving.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://mcdaniel2018.com/\" target=\"_blank\">McDaniel</a><span> was the top vote-getter in a 2014 primary but narrowly lost in a bitter runoff by to longtime incumbent Cochran. The senator’s return to Washington was boosted by overtures to Democratic-leaning African-American voters — a political theft in McDaniel’s mind.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>He refused to concede and defiantly filed a lawsuit alleging rampant voter fraud. He complained that Cochran wooed Democrats who didn’t intend to vote for him in the general election.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>A Mississippi state judge dismissed the lawsuit.</span><b> </b>But the GOP establishment, already wary of McDaniel, grew even more distant.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“Chris McDaniel left a pretty bitter taste in Republicans’ mouths at the conclusion by filing the court challenge dragging the GOP through the mud,” former state Sen. Merle Flowers told the Associated Press in February.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Still, McDaniel believes there’s enough lingering voter resentment over the 2014 runoff and anger toward GOP elites – read Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. - to take him to victory.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“A lot of individuals still feel like that race was stolen from them in 2014,” he said. “There’s a lot of conversation about that and how it wasn’t fair and how that was the system working against the people just as the system has always worked against the people.”</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>McDaniel was hoping for a much-needed endorsement from Trump — who tweeted in 2014 that McDaniel “is strong, he is smart &amp; he wants to change things in Washington” — to boost his campaign.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>But instead of supporting a political kindred spirit in McDaniel, Trump opted to back Hyde-Smith, a former Democrat who was appointed by Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant to temporarily fill Cochran’s seat.</span></p><p> <!-- %asset:218265240% --> </p><p> <!-- %asset:218264925% --> </p><p><span>The people of Mississippi understand that President Trump occasionally has to cut deals by Mitch McConnell,” McDaniel said of the endorsement. “How else can you explain that he endorsed Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and John McCain? These are individuals who are hostile toward a President Trump, yet President Trump endorsed them.”</span></p><p>Still, McDaniel is reeling. The millions in campaign contributions that poured into McDaniel coffers from tea party and conservative political action committees in 2014 have slowed to a trickle, if they come at all.</p><p><span>And the celebrity-filled Tea Party Express campaign </span><a href=\"http://www.teapartyexpress.org/8152/tea-party-express-bus-is-rolling-to-mississippi\" target=\"_blank\">tour bus</a><span> that roared through Mississippi on McDaniel’s behalf in 2014 won’t be there in 2018, according to Sal Russo, a co-founder and strategist for the group.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Tea Party Express has always been a believer of (conservative commentator and author) Bill Buckley’s rule to support the most electable conservative,” Russo said. “We’re not afraid of taking a chance, but we have to see a path to victory.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">McDaniel says that path is being blocked by a Mississippi and national Republican establishment that’s trying to suffocate his campaign.

              "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>A move by prosecutors deciding who was responsible for July’s sinking of a Branson duck boat may mean it will be years before victims and their families get their days in court.</p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Soon after a <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/missouri/article215212175.html\" target=\"_self\">duck boat sank on Table Rock Lake</a>, relatives of some of the 17 who died, survivors and even a rescuer filed suit.</p><p>But a move by federal prosecutors investigating the July 19 tragedy could put those cases on hold indefinitely. For victims and their families, it might be years before they get their day in court.</p><p>“The families want justice and closure,” attorneys for some of the victims said in a federal court filing last week. “These families brought this action to get answers to what happened and to ensure it does not happen to someone else’s family in the future.</p><p>“The efforts of the United States Attorney to delay closure for the victims will only prolong their suffering.”</p><p>And it could mean that the public may have to wait indefinitely to learn exactly what happened that July night when a Ride the Ducks boat sank in stormy weather on the southwest Missouri lake.</p><p>Federal prosecutors have asked courts to halt all discovery and release of information until their criminal investigation is complete. If approved, the action would stall depositions, examination of evidence and requests for records.</p><p>“This just delays everything and keeps these wounds open — it doesn’t allow these families to move on,” said Gerald McGonagle, a Kansas City attorney representing the daughters of a Higginsville couple who died in the tragedy. “There’s no reason to stop us from getting documents, there’s no reason to stop us from deposing witnesses and moving forward with the process.”</p><p>At this point, no one is charged in relation to the tragedy and there’s no way to know when the investigation will be completed. Some federal cases take years before they make it to trial.</p><p>Prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri have argued that the action is necessary to prevent civil lawsuits from interfering with the federal probe. The release of information, they say, could create a “severe prejudice” in their investigation.</p><p>When contacted recently about the motion, Don Ledford, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office, said he could not comment.</p><p>Adam Graves, another Kansas City attorney working on the Higginsville family’s lawsuit — which was filed in Taney County — said when someone from the U.S. Attorney’s office first contacted him about the motion, he was told that it would be “a very limited stay of about six months.”</p><p>“He said, ‘We don’t want to get in the way; we understand these families need their day in court,’” Graves said. “But now they’ve asked for a stay that will include all the way through criminal trial and beyond. So we could be talking five, eight years.”</p><p>Robert Mongeluzzi, a Philadelphia attorney representing several plaintiffs who have sued Ripley Entertainment — current owner of the Branson operation — and Ride the Ducks International in federal court, filed an objection to the stay last week and sought some middle ground.</p><p>That objection proposed ways the civil cases could advance without hindering the government’s probe or jeopardizing the rights of those under investigation. It suggested plaintiffs’ attorneys could wait nine months before testing physical evidence or questioning criminal targets as well as others essential to the investigation.</p><p>That waiting period would allow plaintiffs’ attorneys to carry out additional matters, such as questioning witnesses who saw the duck boat sink and passengers on a nearby boat that didn’t sink.</p><p>In mid-August, the U.S. Coast Guard <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/missouri/article217073595.html\" target=\"_self\">referred the criminal investigation</a> to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri to pursue possible federal charges. That office, based in Kansas City, includes the Table Rock Lake area.</p><p>The Coast Guard notified prosecutors that its preliminary determination was that the sinking of Stretch Duck 07 and the loss of lives “resulted from the misconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties of the captain of the vessel at the time of the sinking, which is a violation of federal criminal law.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:215301795% --> </p><p>The first 911 call about the boat came at 7:09 p.m., 14 minutes after the boat entered the water that July night. The popular Branson tourist attraction takes passengers on a tour of land and water.</p><p>The National Weather Service had <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/missouri/article215222260.html\" target=\"_blank\">issued a severe thunderstorm warning</a> at 6:32 p.m., specifically naming Table Rock Lake. The warning said winds in excess of 60 mph were possible. In reality, winds on the lake reached nearly hurricane level at 73 mph, with waves of more than 3 feet.</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/missouri/article215671830.html\" target=\"_self\">recent report by the National Transportation Safety Board</a>, the captain and driver were on board at 6:28 that evening when someone stepped onto the back of the boat and told the crew to take the water portion of the tour first. It isn’t known who that person is. The driver, whose job is to steer the duck boat on land, died in the sinking.</p><p>Stretch Duck 07 entered the water at 6:55 p.m.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/missouri/article215233100.html\" target=\"_self\">Cellphone video taken from the nearby Showboat Branson Belle</a>, which was docked at the time of the storm, captured the two boats as they struggled in the water. A viral video of the incident ended right before the boat went under. The boat’s captain, Kenneth Scott McKee, was among the 14 survivors.</p><p>According to a recent court filing, McKee and the other boat captain — Barry King — are <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article217514420.html\" target=\"_self\">targets of the ongoing criminal investigation</a>. They are under investigation for allegedly operating the vessel in a manner that endangered lives.</p><p><a href=\"https://cue.misitemgr.com/The%20Branson%20boat%E2%80%99s%20certificate%20%E2%80%94%20which%20The%20Star%20requested%20immediately%20after%20the%20July%2019%20tragedy%20%E2%80%94%20set%20stringent%20guidelines%20for%20wind%20and%20water%20conditions.%20%E2%80%9CVessel%20shall%20not%20be%20operated%20waterborne%20when%20winds%20exceed%2035%20mph,%20and/or%20the%20wave%20height%20exceeds%20two%20feet,%E2%80%9D%20said%20the%20certificate%20issued%20in%20February%202017.\" target=\"_self\">The certificate of inspection for Stretch Duck 07</a> set stringent guidelines for wind and water conditions. It states that the “vessel shall not be operated waterborne when winds exceed 35 mph, and/or the wave height exceeds two feet.”</p><p>One major concern with the motion, Graves said, is that a long delay could prevent the victims’ attorneys from gaining access to the duck boat to try to determine if it had mechanical or design problems. And the longer the boat sits, he said, the more difficult that will be.</p><p>“We might never know if a part was defective or if it just went bad from sitting so long,” he said. “There’s a whole host of problems.”</p><p>Another issue is that plaintiffs would have trouble determining whether they have included all the proper parties in their lawsuits.</p><p>It’s not just the victims’ families who would suffer from a delay. The public could also be left in the dark about the safety of the duck boats.</p><p>“These things are still operating all across the U.S., in Hawaii and the Caribbean,” Graves said. “I think it’s important for the public to be aware that these things are deadly, and here’s why they’re deadly.”</p><p>The Star requested information from the Coast Guard related to the captain’s license. That request was denied because it “relates to a pending law enforcement investigation.”</p><p>“Therefore, I am withholding all records, documents, and/or other material, which if disclosed prior to completion, could reasonably be expected to interfere with law enforcement proceedings and final agency actions related to those proceedings,” wrote Captain K.R. Martin, in a letter to The Star.</p><p>A hearing on the motion to stay discovery in the federal lawsuits has been scheduled for Nov. 1 in Springfield. A hearing on the lawsuits in state court will be heard at a separate, undetermined time.</p><p>On the federal motion, attorneys for the victims and their families will argue there’s an emotional component involved when information is withheld for long periods of time. Especially when other duck boats across the country are still on the water.</p><p>“Completely shutting down all civil cases for an unlimited amount of time, as the government requests, is not the answer,” the objection said. “It would be inefficient, unwarranted and highly prejudicial to plaintiffs and to the victims of this tragedy. Justice delayed is justice denied.”</p></div>",

Two would amend the Missouri Constitution and a third would legalize cannabis by state statute.</p><p>One constitutional amendment, promoted by an organization called A New Approach Missouri, would allow doctors to prescribe cannabis for 10 specific medical issues, including epilepsy, cancer, chronic pain and PTSD. The measure would tax medical marijuana sales and direct the revenue toward health for veterans through the Missouri Veterans Commission.</p><p>The second constitutional amendment is promoted by Springfield, Mo., lawyer and physician Brad Bradshaw. It would create a state research institute that could determine what medical conditions can be treated with marijuana. It also would direct some tax revenue for veterans’ health care.</p><p>The third ballot measure is called the Missourians for Patient Care Act. Its proponents say it would be easier to set up a regulatory framework for medical marijuana under a statute that can be amended than it would a constitutional amendment that could only be changed by another vote of the people. </p><p>Grissom, who was appointed U.S. attorney by former President Barack Obama and served from 2010 to 2016, said public support for marijuana legalization has risen from 12 percent in 1969 to 61 percent now. If he was running for elective office, Grissom said, “I’m going to ride that horse.”<br/><br/></p><p>The former prosecutor also noted that cannabis legalization is not a partisan issue, pointing out that Hillary Clinton lost the electoral vote in North Dakota, Arkansas and Florida — three states that approved medical marijuana. </p><p>Grissom said that even before he stepped down as U.S. attorney he paid a surprise visit to the Washington office of <a href=\"http://norml.org/\" target=\"_self\">NORML</a>, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, and said “I’m here to help.” <br/><br/></p><p>Now in private practice, Grissom told his audience at the Crowne Plaza hotel that he does not use cannabis. But he said he believes it is bad public policy to use resources to prosecute and incarcerate people who do.<br/><br/></p><p>Grissom said legalizing marijuana creates jobs and money that does not go to cartels or other bad actors. But he said existing banking laws and regulations remain a challenge to those who would become entrepreneurs in a legal marijuana environment.</p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill and Attorney General Josh Hawley pulled no punches in their first face-to-face showdown of the 2018 campaign Friday, with each hammering the other on issues ranging from health care to judicial nominations to tax returns.</p><p>At a Friday candidate forum sponsored by the Missouri Press Association, Hawley, a Republican, sought to paint McCaskill as a “Washington liberal” who was out of step with Missouri voters. He vowed to work to enact President Donald Trump’s agenda if he unseats McCaskill in November.</p><p>“I have heard what the people of this state said in 2016,” said Hawley, noting Trump’s 19-percentage-point victory in Missouri two years ago.</p><p>McCaskill, a Democrat, said her record shows she’s a moderate who is willing to work across the aisle to get things done for Missouri. She said Hawley, by contrast, has demonstrated an unwillingness to stand up to the president or his own party.</p><p>“If you want someone who always agrees with his party,” McCaskill said, “then Josh Hawley is your candidate.”</p><p>She cited Hawley’s support for Trump’s trade war as an example, saying Hawley is siding with the president instead of Missouri farmers who are being financially hurt by tariffs implemented by the president.</p><p>“You have to have independence,” McCaskill said of Hawley. “You have to stand up for your state.”</p><p>Hawley said he supports Trump’s approach of using tariffs to force better trade deals, as well as his plan to provide direct financial assistance to farmers impacted by the trade war with China.</p><p>“If we’re going to be in a war,” he said, “I want to win it.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article218331330.html\" target=\"_self\">Hawley, whose office joined 20 other attorneys general</a> around the country in a lawsuit seeking to repeal the Affordable Care Act, said McCaskill has been lying when she says he is trying to eliminate requirements that insurance companies cover those with pre-existing medical conditions.</p><p>Protections for pre-existing conditions don’t have to be tied to the federal health care law, he said, which has only served to drive up insurance premiums for Missourians.</p><p>“I will never support taking away health insurance coverage for those with pre-existing conditions,” he said.</p><p>The attorney general is engaging in a “Potomac two-step,” McCaskill said, arguing that if Hawley’s lawsuit is successful the mandate to cover pre-existing conditions will also be repealed.</p><p>Asked about the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, McCaskill said she has not yet made up her mind on whether to support him but expressed concern about some of his opinions on “dark money.”</p><p>She said she supported nearly all of former Republican President George W. Bush’s nominees and two-thirds of Trump’s.</p><p>“I don’t think that’s a record of an obstructionist,” she said.</p><p>Hawley said Kavanaugh is the kind of judge Missourians said they wanted to put on the bench when they voted for Trump. McCaskill, he said, supported every one of “President Obama’s liberal nominees” while opposing the nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch last year.</p><p>She only supports nominees to the Supreme Court, Hawley said, who want to “force the government to help illegal immigrant teen-agers get abortions, throw open our borders and take away our second amendment rights.”</p><p>One of Hawley’s main lines of attack Friday during the debate — and again afterward to reporters — was an accusation that McCaskill and her husband Joe Shepard, a developer, pocketed $131 million in federal subsidies.</p><p>Hawley and his wife released their 2017 tax returns this week. McCaskill released only her returns, as she and Shepard file separately. Hawley is demanding Shepard’s tax returns be released.</p><p>“Release your returns, and if you won’t, will you pledge to give back the $131 million in federal subsidies that you’ve taken and gotten rich off of?” Hawley said.</p><p>His characterization of that figure is inaccurate, as are GOP ads that make similar claims. The $131 million figure comes from <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article215234680.html\" target=\"_self\">a Kansas City Star investigation published in July</a>. As McCaskill pointed out during the debate, The Star reported that the money did not go directly to Shepard but to affordable housing projects he’s invested in.</p><p>Shepard only pocketed a fraction of that total, although his personal income from his investments in those businesses did grow exponentially during his wife’s two terms in the Senate.</p><p>In 2006, the year McCaskill was elected to the Senate, her husband’s personal income from his investments in federal housing projects was between $1,608 and $16,731, The Star found.</p><p>By 2017, Shepard was reporting personal earnings of between $365,374 and $1,118,158 from investments in such projects.</p><p>The Star’s article also noted that there’s no evidence McCaskill played any role in directing the federal funds to businesses her husband was invested in.</p><p>McCaskill said every year Republicans try to demonize her husband’s success by distorting the truth about his business.</p><p>“He’s a very successful businessman,” she said. “He’s done exactly what the Republican Party preaches. He started out with nothing and built a fabulously successful business, creating thousands of jobs and great wealth.”</p><p>Also on the stage were Green Party candidate Jo Crain and independent candidate Craig O’Dear. Libertarian candidate Japheth Campbell did not attend.</p><p>O’Dear said the ugly tone of the Senate campaign is exactly why he’s running as an independent.</p><p>“Both of these candidates are claiming independence and claiming the other one is not,” he said. “There is a reason. They know exactly what the problem is. They know exactly what the antidote is. That’s independence.”</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\">Lindsay Wise of The Star’s Washington bureau contributed to this report.</div></div>",

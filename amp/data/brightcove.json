    "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n            <p>Johnson County will accept nearly 1,500 provisional ballots either in full or in part, but there is confusion about the status of some unaffiliated voters. </p>\n          </div>",
    "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Small numbers of ballots in Johnson and Sedgwick counties are at the center of dispute between the backers of Gov. Jeff Colyer and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach in a primary race that may eventually be settled in court.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kansas law allows unaffiliated voters to declare their party on Election Day and vote in the primary, but the supporters of the two Republican rivals disagree whether this law puts the burden on voters or poll workers to ensure the paperwork is properly completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">And the state’s two largest counties <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216489915.html\">don’t appear to be handling the issue uniformly.</a></p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker, the deputy whom Kobach has tapped to oversee vote counting in the historically close election, said in a news release Sunday night that “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216584870.html\">Rucker issued his release less than 12 hours</a> before the bulk of the state’s counties, including its two most populous, were set to begin canvassing, a process that will determine whether <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216446680.html\">thousands of provisional ballots count</a> in a race where a few hundred votes separate the candidates. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Brant Laue, Colyer’s chief counsel, argued in a letter Monday morning that Kansas law requires counties to accept ballots from unaffiliated voters regardless of whether the registration switch was completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Laue said on letterhead from the governor’s office.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Both Johnson and<a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\"> Sedgwick counties </a>voted to accept thousands of provisional ballots Monday, but a handful of ballots in each of the counties could be at the center of litigation if the primary fails to yield a clear winner after canvassing is completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach saw his lead on Colyer grow to 206 votes by 5 p.m. as more than 60 smaller counties processed their provisional ballots. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sedgwick and Johnson counties, which account for more than 40 percent of the state’s provisional ballots, will certify their new vote totals Tuesday.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Rucker <a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\">called Sedgwick County to complain</a> immediately after the county’s canvassing board voted to approve 14 ballots where an unaffiliated voter failed to check the box for party label. He argued with the county’s lawyer about the legality of their inclusion in the vote tally. </p>\n            <h3>Confusion in JoCo</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">In Johnson County, Colyer’s campaign staff left a canvassing meeting thinking that the state’s most populous county would be counting all unaffiliated voters who cast ballots in governor primary.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">But it appears that Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker misspoke on the issue, leading to confusion about which ballots will be counted when Johnson County does its final tally on Tuesday.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Metsker referred to questions about the status of unaffiliated voters who were wrongly told to cast provisional ballots at their polling places and said votes would be counted for 57 unaffiliated voters in Johnson County who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">After the meeting, The Star asked Metsker specifically whether this meant that voters who were told to cast provisional ballots instead of declaring a party would see their votes counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“That’s correct. We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Clay Barker, Colyer’s special assistant, took Metsker’s assurances as a sign that the county was not following Rucker’s guidance.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“It would appear to me that the county commissioners, with counsel from their elections commissioner and legal counsel, decided to ignore it and do what they’ve done in the past, which is count ballots because they show a poll worker’s mistake,” said Barker, an attorney who previously served as executive director of the Kansas Republican Party.</p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216595325% -->\n            </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The Johnson County Board of Canvassers voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 provisional ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations. The 57 ballots from unaffiliated voters that declared parties are part of that total.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">But the board also voted unanimously to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons, including 35 ballots for which a voter failed to declare a party.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach’s spokeswoman, Danedri Herbert, contacted The Star shortly after the meeting to emphasize the distinction.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“I just think it’s important to understand the difference because other counties are now trying to follow Johnson County’s lead,” Herbert said.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Ed Eilert, who chairs the canvassing board and the Johnson County Commission, said he thought the distinction between which unaffiliated voters would count and which would not was clear at the meeting.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Regarding the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t count, Eilert said, most were mail-in ballots, according to his notes.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“There’s a place on there if you’re unaffiliated to mark the party and they didn’t,” Eilert said. “That’s the difference between the two.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The canvassing board, which is made up by the county’s commissioners, also voted to accept 275 ballots in part. Most of these ballots are from people who went to the wrong polling place on Election Day. Their votes for all statewide races, such as the primary for governor, will count.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"> Colyer’s campaign referred to Laue’s letter when asked about the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t be counted.</p>\n            <h3>More scrutiny in Sedgwick County</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The issue of unaffiliated voters received more scrutiny in Sedgwick County.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sedgwick County Commissioner David Dennis said it would have been easy for voters to miss what he called the “tiny box” on the form.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">And Sedgwick County Commissioner Jim Howell said the voters would have had to tell election workers which party they wanted to join to obtain a ballot. He also said he thinks the election officials at the polls should have checked that the form was completed before giving a ballot to the voter. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Tabitha Lehman, the county’s election commissioner, remained neutral on the issue of whether the votes should be counted. But she did say she trains poll workers not to advise voters on how to fill out the forms because she doesn’t want them to be seen as encouraging voters to affiliate with one party or another.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The confusion for voters was scorned by Cille King, a co-president for the League of Women Voters of Kansas. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">If poll workers instructed the voter wrong, “I don’t think the voter should be penalized,” King said.</p>\n            <h3>Other counties</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">In 11 other Kansas counties surveyed by The Star that sorted through provisional and mail-in votes Monday, there was no question that previously unaffiliated voters’ ballots would be counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Rick Piepho, the county clerk and election officer of Harvey County, said unaffiliated voters should declare a party simply by going through the provisional ballot process.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“On the provisional envelope — at least on ours — there’s a box on there that says I’m declaring such-and-such ... party and we have them declare on there, so when they’re signing the provisional envelope they’re also signing that declaration,” Piepho said. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Most poll workers in these smaller counties asked unaffiliated voters to fill out a voter affiliation card or a voter registration card to declare their party, and they were given a standard ballot to vote in that party’s primary, clerks said. A few voters were asked to vote provisionally, which clerks attributed to poll worker error, but those votes were counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“They had to fill out a card in order to be able to get a ballot,” McPherson County Clerk Hollie Melroy said.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sonya Stohs, county clerk in Marshall County, said 18 unaffiliated voters at two polling places in her county were asked to fill out provisional ballots because of poll worker error, but they all counted. </p>\n            <h3>Postmarks and other issues</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Among the 898 votes thrown out Monday in Johnson County were four mail-in ballots that lacked a postmark or had an illegible postmark.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach’s office advised counties that these types of ballots could not be counted last week, which prompted Colyer to call on the state’s chief election official to recuse himself from the process.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Votes won’t count for an additional 59 people who did not provide photo ID as required by Kansas law. And 272 people registered in one party tried to vote in the other party’s primary.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">One voter died after casting a ballot, which prompted the election office to recommend the vote be treated as invalid.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“We only had one of those, thank God,” Metsker told the commissioners.</p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216341105% -->\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216340375% -->\n            </p>\n          </div>",

            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Kansas’ two biggest counties made different decisions on how to count some ballots from last week’s election, meaning that some Sedgwick County voters who messed up on a form will have their votes count, while Johnson County voters who did the same thing won’t.</p><p>The conflict only affects 49 ballots out of more 200,000 cast statewide. In an ordinary election year it probably would have gone unnoticed. </p><p>But this time, those could be critical votes with Secretary of State Kris Kobach leading Gov. Jeff Colyer in the Republican race for governor by only 206 votes at the end of the business day Monday. </p><p>At issue are disputed provisional ballots, which were cast by voters who tried to switch from no-party status to affiliating with a party so they could vote in the primary on election day.</p><p>State law allows that last-minute switch, but there is a form for that and some voters didn’t fill out the form correctly.</p><p>Sedgwick County officials voted Monday to give those voters the benefit of the doubt; Johnson County officials voted to toss the ballots out.</p><p>Those decisions affect 14 Sedgwick County votes and 35 Johnson County votes.</p><p>Overall, Sedgwick County’s election board voted to count 1,326 provisional and disputed ballots, adding them to the total votes from the Aug. 7 primary election. </p><p>The results will be announced Tuesday morning.<br/><br/></p><p>The most disputed were 14 ballots cast at the polls by unaffiliated voters who indicated they wished to declare a party and vote in the primary, but who failed to check a box indicating the party of their choice on the form.</p><p>The election board voted 4-1 to count those votes.</p><p>The board is by law made up of the members of the Sedgwick County Commission. On Monday, one commissioner, Richard Ranzau, couldn’t be there, so his seat was taken by Karen Bailey, the chief deputy county clerk who was appointed as substitute. </p><p>Bailey was the only “no” vote on counting the 14 disputed ballots.</p><p>Commissioner David Dennis said it would have been easy for voters to miss what he called the “tiny box” on the form.</p><p>And Commissioner Jim Howell said the voters would have had to tell election workers which party they wanted to join to obtain a ballot. He also said he thinks the election officials at the polls should have checked that the form was completed before giving a ballot to the voter. </p><p>Election Commissioner Tabitha Lehman remained neutral on the issue of whether the votes should be counted. But she did say she trains poll workers not to advise voters on how to fill out the forms because she doesn’t want them to be seen as encouraging voters to affiliate themselves with one party or another.</p><p>The decisions of which votes to count were part of canvassing the vote, a process that is usually ministerial and noncontroversial. But it’s been magnified this election because of the whisker-thin margin in the race for the Republican nomination for governor.</p><p>Immediately after the decision to count the 14 disputed ballots, Kobach’s assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker called to object, arguing over the legality of the decision with Sedgwick County Counselor Eric Yost.<br/><br/></p><p>Under pressure from Colyer and his campaign team, Kobach has recused himself from overseeing the election. He appointed Rucker, his employee and a supporter of his campaign, to act as chief election official in his place.</p><p>The ballots approved by the election board are now being counted by election office workers.</p><p>Many of those ballots will have to be counted by hand.</p><p>Results are expected to be reported at 10 a.m. Tuesday at the Historic Courthouse downtown.<br/><br/></p><p>While Sedgwick County has decided to count the disputed ballots from unaffiliated voters the state’s other major county decided not to. </p><p> <!-- %asset:216595325% --> </p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker apparently misspoke on the issue Monday morning, leading to confusion for the Colyer campaign and others about which ballots will be counted when Johnson County does its final vote tally Tuesday afternoon.<br/><br/></p><p>Metsker said 57 unaffiliated voters in Johnson County who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots would have their votes counted.</p><p>After the meeting, The Kansas City Star asked Metsker specifically whether this meant that voters who were told to cast provisional ballots without declaring a party would see their votes counted.</p><p>“That’s correct. We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied. “These are citizens. We train them. We train them hard. There were a number of problems at that location.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216610415% --></p><p>However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party.</p><p>“This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.”</p><p>But that doesn’t include the 35 other provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who did not mark a form to declare a party. Those votes will be disallowed.</p><p>The Johnson County election board voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations.</p><p>The board also voted to accept 275 ballots in part and to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons. </p><p>The Johnson County board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.<br/><br/></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"436\" style=\"width: 327pt;\"> <colgroup><col width=\"368\"

Jeff Colyer’s office as the feud between the two Republican candidates continues. </p><p>As county canvassing boards began to meet Monday to review provisional votes, Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker said in an email late Sunday that “there has been considerable public discussion regarding whether unaffiliated voters can participate in Kansas party primary elections.”</p><p>He then attached a series of legal instructions including that “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p><p>Under Kansas law, unaffiliated voters are able to declare a party at the polls, and then vote in that party’s primary. Kansas law does not allow for open Republican and Democratic primaries.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign late last week voiced concerns about unaffiliated voters who were incorrectly told by poll workers to cast provisional ballots.</p><p>The governor’s office argued in a legal opinion sent to The Star Monday morning that “Kansas law requires canvassers to look to the intent of the voter” in cases where a poll worker incorrectly tells an unaffiliated voter to cast a provisional ballot, rather than to affiliate and then vote.</p><p>“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Brant Laue, the chief legal counsel of the governor’s office, said in the letter.</p><p>Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, has a <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article216487350.html\" target=\"_self\">slim lead, 110 votes, over Colyer in the GOP primary for governor</a>. Roughly 9,000 provisional ballots are spread across the state’s 105 counties. More than 40 percent of those ballots come from Johnson and Sedgwick counties, where Kobach has appointed the top election officials.</p><p>After initially resisting calls that he recuse himself from duties overseeing the election, Kobach eventually recused himself last week and named Rucker.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign also has alleged that “many Colyer voters had difficulties finding his name on the ballot, were forced to vote on provisional ballots, or were turned away outright for unknown reasons.”<br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:216521210% --></p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Gov. Jeff Colyer’s campaign staff left Monday morning’s canvassing meeting in Johnson County with the belief that the state’s most populous county would be counting all unaffiliated voters who cast ballots in the primary for governor. </p><p>But it appears that Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker misspoke on the issue Monday morning, leading to confusion for the Colyer campaign and others about which ballots will be counted when Johnson County does its final vote tally Tuesday. </p><p>Metsker referred to questions about the status of unaffiliated voters who were wrongly told to cast provisional ballots at their polling places and said 57 unaffiliated voters in Johnson County who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots would have their votes counted. </p><p>After the meeting, The Star asked Metsker specifically whether this meant that voters who were told to cast provisional ballots instead of declaring a party would see their votes counted. </p><p>“That’s correct. We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied. “These are citizens. We train them. We train them hard. There were a number of problems at that location.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216610415% --> </p><p>However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party. </p><p> “This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.” </p><p>The distinction affects 35 other ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who did not declare a party and won’t have their ballots counted.</p><p>The Johnson County Board of Canvassers voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations. </p><p> The canvassing board, which is made up by the county’s commissioners, also voted to accept 275 ballots in part and to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons. The majority of voters who will only have their ballots partially counted went to the wrong polling place on Election Day. Their votes for all statewide races, such as the primary for governor, will count.</p><p>The board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign raised concerns last week that unaffiliated voters who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots would not have their votes counted.</p><p>Kansas law allows unaffiliated voters to declare a party on the day of the primary to vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary.</p><p>Assistant Kansas Secretary of State Eric Rucker issued a guidance late Sunday night saying that if “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p><p>Clay Barker, Colyer’s special assistant, took Metsker’s assurances at the Monday meeting as a sign that the county was not following Rucker’s guidance. </p><p>“It would appear to me that the county commissioners with counsel from their elections commissioner and legal counsel decided to ignore it and do what they’ve done in the past, which is count ballots because they show a poll worker’s mistake,” said Barker, an attorney who previously served as executive director of the Kansas Republican Party.</p><p>Kobach’s spokeswoman, Danedri Herbert, contacted The Star shortly after the meeting to dispute that all of these ballots were being accepted. </p><p>“I just think it’s important to understand the difference, because other counties are now trying to follow Johnson County’s lead,” Herbert said. </p><p>Ed Eilert, who chairs the canvassing board and the county commission, said that he believes the distinction between which unaffiliated voters would count and which would not was clear at the meeting. </p><p>Regarding the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t count Eilert said that those are mostly mail-in ballots, according to his notes. </p><p>“There’s a place on there if you’re unaffiliated to mark the party and they didn’t,” Eilert said. “That’s the difference between the two.” </p><p>The issue also came up during Sedgwick County’s canvassing meeting. That county’s canvassing board voted<a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\" target=\"_blank\"> to accept 14 ballots cast by unaffiliated voters </a>who did not check a box marking party affiliation. </p><p>Rucker called Sedgwick County to object about the inclusion of the ballots immediately after the county’s vote, arguing about their legality with Sedgwick County Counselor Eric Yost. </p><p>The dispute could wind up in court. </p><p>Brant Laue, Colyer’s chief counsel, argued in a letter Monday morning that Kansas law requires counties to accept ballots from unaffiliated voters regardless of whether the registration switch was completed. Colyer’s campaign pointed back to this letter when asked for a comment about the confusion in Johnson County. </p><p>“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Laue said in a letter on letterhead from the governor’s office.</p><p>The confusion for voters was scorned by Cille King, a co-president for the League of Women Voters of Kansas. </p><p>If poll workers instructed the voter wrong, “I don’t think the voter should be penalized,” King said.</p><p>Among the 898 votes that were thrown out Monday in Johnson County were four mail-in ballots that lacked a postmark or had an illegible postmark.</p><p>Kobach’s office advised counties that these types of ballots couldnot be counted last week, which prompted Colyer to call on the state’s chiefelection official to recuse himself from the process.</p><p>An additional 59 people will not have their votes counted because they did notprovide photo ID as required by Kansas law. And 272 people tried to vote in theother party’s primary. </p><p>One voter died after casting a ballot, which prompted the election office to recommend the vote be treated as invalid.</p><p>“We only had one of those. Thank God,” Metsker told the commissioners.</p><p><!-- %asset:216341105% --> </p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

            "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Kansas Democrats don’t yet know which Republican they’ll face in the general election for governor. They says that’s a good thing.</p></div>",
            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kansas Democrats are delighted by the continuing battle between Kris Kobach and Jeff Colyer in the Republican race for governor. The prolonged uncertainty over who will win the primary election effectively hands Democrats “buckets of free money,” they say.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Republican race for governor may remain undecided for weeks and potentially end in lawsuits. Democrats say the extended drama gives them a head start on fundraising and organizing going into the general election season.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“It’s as if the Republicans are handing us buckets and buckets of free money … it’s days their money isn’t being used to attack anybody,” said Chris Reeves, a Democratic national committeeman in Kansas.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans are downplaying the possibility the unresolved contest between Kobach and Colyer, the current governor, will ultimately harm them in November. But they acknowledge the standoff could slow fundraising on their side.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kansas Republican Party Chairman Kelly Arnold said the uncertainty about the nominee “makes it a little more difficult for the campaigns to raise money … until they know they’re the candidate.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“You’ve got a number of people … who kind of wait until after the primaries are over because they’re there to support our nominee,” Arnold said. “Many of them are still sitting on the sidelines waiting.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">On Friday, Kobach, the secretary of state, held a lead of 110 votes, according to his office. The margin will almost certainly change when county election officials begin sifting through provisional ballots Monday.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The final results may not be certified until Aug. 31. Recounts and litigation remain possible.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">“We want the Republicans to spend as much time as they need to while we’re out talking to voters about what the future looks like,” Kansas House Minority Leader Jim Ward, a Wichita Democrat, said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">State Sen. Laura Kelly easily won the Democratic nomination for governor on election night and transitioned into general election mode. She has said it doesn’t matter whether she ends up facing Colyer or Kobach.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“The longer the story is indecision, confusion, disunity on the Republican side, I think the better that is for Democrats,” said Ethan Corson, director of the Kansas Democratic Party.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans, on the other hand, are waiting for the vote counting process to finish.</p><p>Arnold called the unresolved race a “temporary obstacle” that the party will work around and said the situation won’t hurt Republicans.<br/><br/></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He said Republicans will begin attacking Kelly right away.<br/><br/></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“We kind of have campaign plan A and campaign plan A.1 depending on which candidate we have,” Arnold said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Political parties typically use the days following a primary to unite and mend relationships frayed during the primary campaign. Parties and campaigns also intensify outreach to donors and activists as they kick off the general election season.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But instead of unifying, tensions are rising between Kobach and Colyer, who became governor six months ago when Sam Brownback resigned.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Colyer on Thursday demanded Kobach recuse himself from providing advice to county election officers and said he had made statements on national TV that were inconsistent with Kansas law. Colyer also hinted at the possibility of litigation.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kobach said Friday afternoon in a letter to Colyer that he would recuse himself from overseeing vote counting but said the decision is symbolic because the counties count votes, not him. He named longtime deputy Eric Rucker to oversee the election in his stead, but the Colyer campaign said his appointment didn’t address their concerns about a conflict of interest.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kobach also said Colyer’s rhetoric risked undermining public confidence in the election process.</p><p><!-- %asset:216335185% --> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">An extended recount or legal process could damage Republicans if candidates become hostile toward each other, said Patrick Miller, a political scientist at the University of Kansas.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“That would cost them time and resources and any of that hostility that gets out in the media doesn’t help the eventual nominee. It doesn’t help heal the wounds that always occur with primaries,” Miller said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Given that Republican voters were sharply divided between Kobach and Colyer, Senate Vice President Jeff Longbine, an Emporia Republican, said Republicans must analyze the results to determine exactly what voters said and carry out a strategy based on that message.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“I think it’s extremely important at this point for the Republican Party to make sure that we are inclusive, that we are listening to everyone’s thoughts and ideas within the party and that we get that unification that we’re going to need to be successful in November,” Longbine said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite the current division, Miller said Republicans still have a built-in structural advantage over Democrats: independent Greg Orman. Miller predicts Orman will draw away Democratic voters.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orman, a Johnson County businessman, isn’t officially on the general election ballot yet. He turned in thousands of signatures Monday to secure a spot and is waiting on the secretary of state’s office to certify the signatures.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“(Republicans) can afford to have damaging events occur, or to nominate someone like Kobach who appears from the polling to be a weaker candidate than Colyer,” Miller said. “They can afford that because they have the opposition split.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orman has rejected the argument that he will only take votes from Democrats. He has said he will build a coalition of Democrats as well as Republicans and independents.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Asked Friday whether the current lack of a Republican nominee helps Orman, campaign spokesman Sam Edelen said that regardless of who the nominee is, “the choice voters will have in November will be clear”: between two career politicians or Orman, a businessman.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans say they’re ready to move on to the general election.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">At a GOP unity breakfast on Wednesday, House Majority Leader Don Hineman, R-Dighton, called on Republicans in all political races to come together.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“What we need to remember is what happened yesterday was an intramural scrimmage,” Hineman said. “What’s coming up is a varsity match.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

              "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>The 2018 Kansas City Chiefs will be exciting. They also might miss the playoffs for just the second time in six years, which is sort of the plan.</p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p class=\"p1\">The secret of the most anticipated Chiefs season in years is that this is not a Super Bowl contender, no matter <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/for-petes-sake/article217786245.html\" target=\"_blank\">what some in the national media are saying</a>.</p><p class=\"p1\">Might not even be a playoff team.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is not written to inflame or mock. This is not written simply because Eric Berry’s health remains uncertain, or the defense looked awful in the preseason. This is a sober look at a team with a first-year starting quarterback, major questions on defense and perhaps most convincingly a line of personnel moves that are subtly but consistently pointing to a more serious push beginning in 2019.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is not a hot take, in other words.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is the plan.</p><p class=\"p1\">Look at the biggest moves. Alex Smith was traded for a Kendall Fuller, a young and rising cornerback, and draft picks, the higher of which comes next year. This happened because the team wanted to build around young quarterback Patrick Mahomes, a tantalizing talent but one who so far has only torched Big 12 defenses at Texas Tech.</p><p class=\"p1\">Cornerback Marcus Peters was also traded, essentially because the organization was tired of repairing and reinforcing and worrying in his wake. Peters is young and game-changing and still cheap. You think a team that believes it’s close to a Super Bowl gives up on that?</p><p class=\"p1\">Of course not, but a team that believes it’s close to a Super Bowl will trade for that, which is why the Rams added him to one of the league’s most talented rosters.</p><p class=\"p1\">The free-agent moves were done with the future in mind, too. Sammy Watkins is just 25, and his red zone effectiveness (seven of his eight touchdowns last year were 17 yards or less) is seen as a complement to the 24-year-old Tyreek Hill (10 of his 13 career touchdown catches are 30 yards or more) to aid the development of the 22-year-old Mahomes.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217921400% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">Anthony Hitchens is just 26, a three-down linebacker the Chiefs think pairs well with Reggie Ragland inside and, more importantly, can be a pillar aside Justin Houston and Eric Berry to strengthen what football people refer to as “the culture.” That’s not a quick fix.</p><p class=\"p1\">You see the commonality here? Get younger, create stable support for a first-year starting quarterback and build a culture that will help rather than impede.</p><p class=\"p1\">The truth is the Chiefs’ defense probably had too many holes to fix all in one offseason, but certain circumstances also played against them.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Chiefs may have prioritized Bears cornerback Kyle Fuller in free agency, and if so it would have been on brand. He’s Kendall’s brother, another dependable teammate, and he would’ve strengthened a premium position.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">But after the Bears used their franchise tag on Fuller, the backup options were less enticing. Trumaine Johnson and Malcolm Butler each had varying so-called “character” questions, which would’ve been a difficult sell while talking about culture.</p><p class=\"p1\">Aaron Colvin would’ve been an upgrade, but the price — $34 million including $18 million guaranteed — was high for a player now listed as a backup on the Texans’ depth chart.</p><p class=\"p1\">So, the Chiefs spent bigger money on fewer players, with the caveat that the talent would still be in prime years in 2019 and 2020.</p><p class=\"p1\">The roster is full of “development guys,” particularly in the secondary — corners Charvarius Ward and Tremon Smith, safety Jordan Lucas and to a slightly lesser extent Armani Watts. The Chiefs will have an extra second-round pick next year, and will likely draft at least one cornerback high.</p><p class=\"p1\">If that’s the way it goes, the biggest concern going forward could be the pass rush. The Chiefs need as much as they can get from Houston as he enters his 30s, and more importantly they need some real production from a second rusher.</p><p class=\"p1\">Dee Ford is the most likely to make an impact in 2018, but he’s inconsistent, with unreliable health, can be a liability against the run, and will be a free agent after the season.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217768120% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">Rookie Breeland Speaks may be better suited inside — he played there in college, and could make an effective tandem with Chris Jones rushing in sub packages. If that’s the way it goes, the Chiefs would need some combination of retaining Ford, getting regular production from Tanoh Kpassagnoh, drafting a pass rusher high, or picking through a free agent class that could include Jadeveon Clowney.</p><p class=\"p1\">The other thing going on here is a tangible priority on the defensive front, perhaps influenced by the current Super Bowl champions.</p><p class=\"p1\">The discussion around the Eagles’ run typically centers around (Reid protege) Doug Pederson’s creativity, and that’s obviously a critical element.</p><p class=\"p1\">But the Eagles also won with a defense that ranked fourth in points, fourth in yards and second in Football Outsiders’ DVOA with a group of corners that nobody would envy. The strength of that group was up front, and with the safeties. The Chiefs could try to emulate.</p><p class=\"p1\">Either way, the Chiefs are approaching this as more than a quick fix. That may mean fewer wins in 2018. If that’s the way this goes, it won’t be a failure.</p><p class=\"p1\">It’ll be the plan.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217344510% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>This isn’t a fantasy advice column. </p><p>So if you’ve clicked on this headline hoping for some guidance on who to sit and who to start in Week 1, you won’t find it here. In fact, you should probably do the opposite of whatever I do. </p><p>Instead, this is a (hopefully) weekly peek inside my all-girls fantasy football league.</p><p>In 2017, 59.3 million people played fantasy sports in the U.S. and Canada, according to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association. The largest chunk — 71 percent — were male, leaving women to make up the remaining 29 percent. </p><p>I’m happy to say that I’m one of the 29 percent, along with the nine other women in my league. </p><p>Founded by my friend Kelsey, we’ve been doing the all-girls league for four years now.</p><p>The league, “Run the World: GRILS” — yes, girls is misspelled, no we don’t know why we haven’t fixed it over the years — is pretty low-stakes. Some years we haven’t wagered any money. This year, we’re doing a $20 buy-in. </p><p>There are 10 players this year, and I only know four of them — Kelsey, Sarah, Erika and Taylor — in real life. The rest are connected through Kelsey and Sarah, whom I became friends with during a study abroad semester in college. </p><p> <!-- %asset:217921400% --> </p><p>The group is a diverse one. Six work in Washington, D.C., including Kelsey and Sarah, who work for Customs and Border Protection and the Justice Department’s public affairs office, respectively. </p><p>Another is a scheduler for a house member from California, one just finished her masters in International and European Politics at the University of Edinburgh and another works for an automotive product manufacturer in Ohio.</p><p>“I had played one season of fantasy previously with people from work which was majority men, so it was exciting that I would be playing with all women,” Erika wrote in our email chain. “I work for an automotive product manufacturer in Columbus (Ohio) which is a male dominated industry, so having an all-lady league is a refreshing opportunity to discuss football with someone other than a middle aged father of three.” </p><p>Preach, girl. </p><p>We have Steelers fans, Giants fans, Patriots fans, Browns fans and fans of watching football with friends on Sunday afternoons. </p><p>And of course, we have me. You’d think a football writer would have an unfair advantage in a fantasy football league. </p><p>You’d also be wrong. </p><p>To be clear, I’m not bad because I don’t understand how it works. I’m bad because I’m a big softy. I draft guys who I’ve covered and ones who I have a genuine interest in following off the field. It mimics my approach for telling stories on the beats I cover, which works great for reporting and not so much for competitive fantasy football leagues. <br/><br/></p><p>Last year Erika — team name Gurley Show — won the league, and Sarah came in second. Laura, known this year as Gronk A Donk, was third. Honestly, I have no idea where I finished, but I know that I didn’t win any money. Based on the fact that I had the third pick this year, I’m guessing I was somewhere toward the bottom. <br/><br/></p><p>With my drafting habits, I know that’s shocking. </p><p>I know some fantasy leagues have elaborate draft ceremonies and make an event out of it. That’s not what we did. Kelsey, the commissioner, sent out an email Sunday night to schedule it. We exchanged emails in a thread through Monday afternoon and hastily decided that Monday night worked best for all of us. </p><p>Because Sarah was catching a flight and others had other fantasy drafts, Kelsey gave us 30 seconds per pick. </p><p>Talk about stress. </p><p>I can’t pick out what scented candle I want at Target in 30 seconds, much less decide on which players will help me to a yet another mediocre finish. </p><p>My team — Post Mahomes — started out on a strong note, picking up Todd Gurley with my first selection. As a fellow North Carolinian, Gurley fits my rule of drafting guys I have some kind of connection to. </p><p>In between rounds, I tried to FaceTime my fiancé for some advice, but things were moving so quickly that I got stressed and ended the call before he could really help. Big mistake. </p><p>He did advise me to draft Christian McCaffrey, which I did. I briefly covered McCaffrey’s brother, Max, at Duke, so it still adheres to my draft method. </p><p>In the next round, I finally put my NFL knowledge to use. I was torn between drafting Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, but ultimately went with Kelce because I think he’ll get more targets than Hill based on the preseason. </p><p>Then I started to panic in the 30-second windows.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">I drafted both </span>Demaryius Thomas<em> </em>and Emmanuel Sanders in back-to-back rounds. I don’t have a good explanation for it, either. I was about to autodraft a defense out of my cue in the seventh round, and I saw Sanders’ name on the list of top available players, so I just pulled the trigger with a second left. Their Bye Week is going to be painful. </p><p>It turns out I wasn’t the only one who panicked under pressure. </p><p>Taylor drafted three defenses and three quarterbacks, and Kelsey forgot to draft a backup quarterback. </p><p>I feel good about my starting lineup — Deshaun Watson, Gurley, McCaffrey, Thomas, Jarvis Landry, Kelce, Sanders, Bears defense and Sebastian Janikowski. My bench is almost entirely players from OU, UNC or North Carolina: Adrian Peterson, Sterling Shepard, Tarik Cohen, Kenny Stills, Gio Bernard and Mitch Trubisky. Calvin Ridley rounds out the bench as the only non-NC or OU tie. </p><p>This week, I’m opening up the season against Kelsey (team name: Captain Kirk And The Giants). She’s ultra-competitive, so I’m already preparing to get my butt kicked. She’s starting Phillip Rivers — bolo tie and all — against KC’s secondary, so I like her chances even more. </p></div>",

But that’s exactly what the oddsmakers in Vegas must do anyway.</p><p>And they envision the Chiefs taking a step backwards, albeit a small one.</p><p>After three consecutive double-digit win seasons, Vegas has placed the Chiefs’ regular season over-under for wins at 8 1/2, according to Bovada. They need nine victories, in other words, to make the over wager a winning ticket.</p><p>The oddsmakers don’t like the Chiefs’ chances to repeat as the AFC West champions either. The Los Angeles Chargers are listed as the favorite to win the division, followed by the Chiefs.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p>Kansas City’s odds to win the Super Bowl are 25-to-1, which falls into the middle of the pack in the NFL. The Patriots are the favorite at 5-to-1, with the Eagles and Rams both 8-to-1.</p><p>What do the odds suggest about the statistical seasons the individual players might produce?</p><p>Let’s start with Mahomes. They have the over/under lines listed at 3,750 yards, 23 touchdowns and 13 1/2 interceptions. Only four players have higher interception totals. But the ceiling on Mahomes remains relatively high. He’s listed at 60-to-1 to win the league’s most valuable player award, tied for the 20th best odds in the NFL. For comparison’s sake, Alex Smith had 4,042 yards, 26 touchdowns and five interceptions in 2017.</p><p>Running back Kareem Hunt led the league in rushing as a rookie last season, finishing with 1,327 yards, eight rushing touchdowns. His 2018 projections in Vegas are 1,150 rushing yards and 10 1/2 rushing touchdowns, per Bovada. Ten players have better odds to win the rushing title than Hunt, even though he holds the belt.</p><p>The forecast for tight end Travis Kelce and wide receiver Tyreek Hill are quite similar. Each has their over/under for receiving yards listed at an even 1,000. Hill’s over/under for total touchdowns — receiving, rushing and returning combined — are seven. Kelce’s receiving touchdowns are listed at six. Hill had 1,183 yards and eight total touchdowns in 2017. Kelce had 1,038 yards and eight touchdowns.</p><p>So why do the sports betting oddsmakers set Kelce and Hill with slightly worse outputs this year? A couple of factors are at play. First, they don’t believe Mahomes will repeat the season Smith had last year. And second, there is another player to split the touches with.</p><p>Incoming wide receiver Sammy Watkins’ over/under for yards and touchdowns in his first season in Kansas City are 800 and 5 1/2, respectively. Those are much higher numbers than the Chiefs got from their No. 2 wide receiver a year ago. While Watkins caught eight scores last season, the yardage would be a significant bump in his production. Watkins had only 593 yards in 2017 with the Rams and just 430 yards in an injury-ravaged season in 2016. An injury, of course, would not negate the wager.</p><p>On the defensive side, linebacker Justin Houston is calculated for eight sacks. Houston has proved one of the most difficult players for Vegas to set lines, given his injury history. He had 9 1/2 sacks in 2017 but only four in 2016 and just 7 1/2 in 2015.</p><p>In their opener, the Chiefs are a 3 1/2-point underdog against the Chargers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> <br/><br/></span></p><p> <!-- %asset:217344670% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>This summer’s public forums on the future of Santa Fe Commons Park in downtown Overland Park generated one clear message from residents: <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/community/joco-913/article215357265.html\" target=\"_blank\">Don’t move the Farmers’ Market to the park</a>.</p><p>But the question remained, how could the city upgrade the space that is downtown’s central park and make it a more vibrant destination for residents, families and visitors?</p><p>On Wednesday night, the council’s community development committee voted unanimously for a plan that keeps the market where it is, at 7950 Marty St., but provides a new performance space, playground and enhanced green space within the park at 8045 Santa Fe Drive. The plan goes to the full council Oct. 1 for consideration.</p><p>“There’s a lot of things that we don’t have that we’ve been asked about over the years,” Park Services Director Greg Ruether told the committee. “What new could go into this location?”<br/><br/></p><p>The budget for the park improvements is $3 million and Ruether said the approved concept is designed to keep to that funding limit. Of the $3 million, $1 million is coming in a donation from retired car dealer Frank Thompson, a longtime philanthropist from Overland Park, and his wife Evangeline. </p><p>On Aug. 6, the city council approved an agreement that calls for Santa Fe Commons Park to be renamed Thompson Park once the upgrades are completed.</p><p>Amenities would include improved restrooms and shelters, a water feature with spray or mist, a contemporary children’s playground, natural play areas and space for table tennis, and a new open performance venue with a “paper airplane” shaped roof that would be a nod to Overland Park’s transportation past. </p><p>The conceptual plan was dubbed “Park Stroll,” by the Omaha-based RDG Planning &amp; Design landscape architecture firm, which came up with <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article213247329.html\" target=\"_blank\">four concepts for the city</a> to consider over the summer. Two concepts were for the park only, and two were for incorporating the farmers’ market into the park. Following several public forums and meetings with downtown business advocates and other stakeholders, Ruether said, the “Park Stroll” concept was the consensus choice.</p><p>It would preserve the existing Carriage House, which dates from the early 1900s, and keep as many of the healthy trees as possible. It calls for replacing the deteriorating bandstand and broken sidewalks and fixing or replacing other aging infrastructure.</p><p>Bruce Niedermyer with RDG said the southern half of the park would remain as open and natural as possible, to create an urban lawn, almost like a “front yard,” for the nearby Santa Fe Towers apartments, whose many residents cherish the park and didn’t want substantial changes.</p><p>Ruether said he had appreciated his meeting with the Santa Fe Towers residents, describing them as “the nicest and most opinionated people.” He said the debate over moving the farmers’ market had been polarizing, but it was a useful discussion, and the feedback from <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article213247329.html\" target=\"_blank\">well over 100 city residents</a> and other stakeholders had been crucial to the city’s decision on the best direction for the park. </p><p>Many people felt shoehorning the farmers’ market into the park would reduce the desirable green space while also cramping the market. Parking was also a concern. City officials have determined that improving the market at its present location honors its 36-year history and is the best option, although those construction upgrades will have to be phased in over time to minimize disruptions to vendors and customers.</p><p>Some residents now have a new concern: they’ve objected to the renaming, arguing it was done with no public input. They believe the Santa Fe Commons name should be preserved and is a better tie to Overland Park’s historical connection to the Santa Fe Trail. But the committee took no testimony on the renaming Wednesday night.</p><p>About three dozen people attended Wednesday’s public hearing, and several testified that they were relieved and pleased with the chosen concept.</p><p>“I think that can make a beautiful addition to our city,” said Linda McGuckin, who lives nearby.</p><p>Others questioned some of the elements.</p><p>“I treasure the fact that the park is natural,” said Rich Kaufman, adding that he thinks all the new park structures will detract from its natural character. He thought the “paper airplane” shaped roof for the performance space was silly and advised, “Get rid of that element. Make it a glider.”</p><p>Kaufman and several others also wondered why the park improvements need to occur now. They suggested the city should wait until multiple downtown construction projects are completed in a few years to see if park changes are really needed.</p><p>But Councilman Paul Lyons opposed waiting and said the city can coordinate the park construction with other projects to try to reduce parking problems and inconvenience.</p><p>“I think we should go full steam ahead,” he said. “I think it’s going to be a great amenity.”</p><p>If the council approves the concept, more detailed designs go to the Overland Park Planning Commission, probably late this year or early next year. Ruether said the schedule calls for construction in 2019.</p></div>",

There have been no injuries or accidents, according to the manufacturer.</p><p>“Ford’s investigation found that some front seat belt pretensioners can generate excessive sparks when they deploy. When sufficient sparks are present, gases exhausted inside the lower portion of the B-pillar by the pretensioners may ignite. If this gas ignites, components behind the B-pillar such as insulation and carpet may subsequently catch fire.”</p><p>Under the recall, dealers will fix the problem for free. Dealers will remove insulation material and some wiring harness tape as well as treat the carpet and insulation with heat-resistant tape, the recall notice said. </p><p>Ford said dealers also would modify the back interior panels of regular cab trucks as part of the fix.</p></div>",

She also previously told the Australian-based court that <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/devout-us-woman-jailed-for-smuggling-cocaine-in-her-high-heels-20180906-p5022m.html\" target=\"_blank\">she fell in love with that man</a>, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The woman has been involved with the order for at least five years, Fox reported, and once considered becoming a nun. </p><p>In January, she pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug, Fox reported. On Thursday, she was <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/denise-woodrum-jailed-australia-cocaine\" target=\"_blank\">sentenced to seven and a half years in prison</a> with a non-parole period of four and a half years, BuzzFeed News reported. </p><p>Woodrum’s laywer, though, believed she had been “groomed” to help Cornelius.</p><p>“There are fraudsters out there who are relying on women who are vulnerable,” attorney Rebecca Neil said  in court, according to the Morning Herald. </p><p>The online couple had texted each other hundreds of romantic messages, BuzzFeed reported, and Woodrum told the court she was scammed by Cornelius and committed the crime “on the promise of a future together.” </p><p>But the judge disagreed that Woodrum, who lived near the Lake of the Ozarks, was “duped,” The Morning Herald reported.</p><p>“I do not accept that she is genuinely contrite for her offending as opposed to being sorry for the situation she now finds herself caught in,” Judge Penelope Wass said on Thursday. “She continues to blame others for her own reckless actions and appears to have little or no insight into her offending.” </p><p>Representatives for Australia’s Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions told The Washington Post that when Woodrum was in the airport, she said she was going to Sydney to see the Harbour Bridge and the aquarium. She also originally said the gold high-heeled shoes were a gift for her mom. </p><p>But once her suitcases were inspected, Woodrum allegedly said “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/08/14/a-devout-woman-thought-she-found-her-true-love-online-then-she-got-busted-for-cocaine-at-the-airport/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.356e62eac6bb\" target=\"_blank\">How much did they put in the shoes?</a> ...

    "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Faulty software code was to blame for an overnight delay in Johnson County’s primary election night results, an embarrassing ordeal that <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article216290855.html\" target=\"_blank\">kept people across the country waiting</a> for the outcome to several high-profile Kansas races.</p><p>“The slow reporting of results was unacceptable and we apologize,” Tom Burt, president and CEO of Election Systems &amp; Software, said in a statement Monday. “We know the election office and other Johnson County government leaders put their faith in us and we let down our valued partners.”</p><p>Burt went on to say that the Omaha-based company, the county’s elections vendor, has rewritten the portion of the code that caused the delay and initial tests of that new code were successful. He said testing will continue so the new software can be certified prior to the general election.</p><p>Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker said Monday that he continues to have faith in ES&amp;S, and he is confident the problem won’t repeat itself in the November general election. Metsker was the prime mover behind the Johnson County Commission’s decision <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article210791069.html\" target=\"_blank\">to spend $10.5 million this summer</a> on this new system of voting machines and software.<br/><br/></p><p>It was the first time this particular system configuration was deployed anywhere in the country. ES&amp;S officials said other communities will soon deploy the same system configuration but they couldn’t provide a list of those customers.</p><p>Election results from the primary election were expected before 10 p.m. Aug. 7 in Johnson County, and those results were especially anticipated for the races for Kansas governor and the Kansas Third Congressional District.</p><p>Instead, final unofficial election results were not released until 8 a.m. on Aug. 8. In addition to the slow reporting of results, Johnson County also experienced <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article216316320.html\" target=\"_blank\">long lines at some of its polling places</a> on election day due to an unusually high turnout and voters who were unaccustomed to a new kind of touchscreen machine.</p><p>ES&amp;S officials said the uploading of tallied votes did not perform as expected on election night, nor as tested prior to the election.</p><p>“While the aggregation and reporting of results were tested prior to the election, they were not tested in the exact scenario that Johnson County experienced,” the company said in a statement. “Most specifically, the number of ballot positions exceeded the number in the test scenario.”</p><p>One computer science professor said Monday that this failure showed the testing was inadequate.<br/><br/></p><p>“The big issue apparently is that they didn’t test this system at scale,” said Duncan Buell, professor of computer science and engineering at the University of South Carolina, who has studied that state’s election results extensively. “You need to test for all possible scenarios.”</p><p>He said there should have been a way to simulate counting a high number of votes prior to Johnson County’s primary election, in which more than 120,000 votes were cast. </p><p>“If you really want to test this system at scale you’ve got to do something like that. It should be feasible,” Buell said.</p><p>Buell had seen a copy of <a href=\"https://jocogov.org/press-release/johnson-county-election-office-and-ess-announce-resolution-slow-reporting-election\" target=\"_blank\">Monday’s press release</a> about the Johnson County vote result problems and said he would be sharing it with his computer science students so they can see how things go wrong in the real world.</p><p>“We require students to write programs like adults and test them and document and make sure things work,” Buell said. “This demonstrates they can ignore us for four years and still get jobs.” </p><p>But Metsker staunchly defended the company. </p><p>“I believe they’re still the best vendor out there, and they’ve got the finest product we could have selected for Johnson County voters,” he said at headquarters in Olathe on Monday. </p><p>“While we were disappointed with what happened on election night in the primary, I am confident they have discovered what they need to do to make the corrections in software so we will not have this problem again.”</p><p>Both Metsker and ES&amp;S officials said the software problem occurred with the “back end” reporting code for results, and not with the vote tabulation software. That reporting code was also separate and distinct from about 1,000 new ExpressVote machines that Johnson County rolled out for the first time in the Aug. 7 primary.</p><p>“We did not experience any issues with the integrity of the new voting machines nor the accuracy of the vote tabulation in August,” Metsker said.</p><p>ES&amp;S officials said the reporting code caused extremely slow results because it was unnecessarily and constantly refreshing statistical data rather than actually processing the data. The new code has fixed that problem and it’s now being extensively tested to make sure it works, said Gary Weber, ES&amp;S vice president of software development, who was in Johnson County on Monday.</p><p>“We’re making changes to the code to make it perform the duties in a faster manner...very much faster,” he said.</p><p>Metsker also said the county will deploy all 2,100 machines in November to alleviate long lines. He said the election office will also recruit 1,000 more election workers to assist voters, about as many as would normally be needed in a presidential election.</p><p>Still, one critic who watches election equipment nationally questioned why Johnson County would have so much confidence that everything will be fine in November.<br/><br/></p><p>Susan Greenhalgh, policy director with the National Election Defense Coalition, suggested Johnson County would be better off with paper ballot machines, rather than with its new touchscreen machines that have a voter verified paper ballot backup for tabulation. Both Greenhalgh and Buell said paper ballot systems are two to three times less expensive than electronic machines and are more efficient and secure.<br/><br/></p><p>“The problems that Johnson County experienced, both the long lines and the slow results uploads, could both be easily solved by using voter-marked paper ballots and scanners.<br/><br/></p><p>“ES&amp;S individual scanners are used across the country without the upload issue of the ExpressVote scanners,” Greenhalgh said. “That Johnson County would not entertain the thought of returning the ExpressVotes and just getting tried-and-true scanners before the midterms is baffling. We know there will be high scrutiny of these elections, and their system is faulty. This makes no sense.”</p><p>Both Metsker and Weber argued that touchscreen machines with a paper backup are preferable. Weber said touchscreen machines make sure a voter doesn’t inadvertently skip a race or vote for more than one candidate in a particular race.</p><p>“This is really the best of both worlds,” Weber said.</p><p>Weber said he is confident the new code can be certified by federal and state officials, possibly by the end of September, well before the Nov. 6 general election.<br/><br/></p></div>",

              "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>An Overland Park Council committee supported improvements to Santa Fe Commons Park without moving the farmers’ market there.</p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>This summer’s public forums on the future of Santa Fe Commons Park in downtown Overland Park generated one clear message from residents: <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/community/joco-913/article215357265.html\" target=\"_blank\">Don’t move the Farmers’ Market to the park</a>.</p><p>But the question remained, how could the city upgrade the space that is downtown’s central park and make it a more vibrant destination for residents, families and visitors?</p><p>On Wednesday night, the council’s community development committee voted unanimously for a plan that keeps the market where it is, at 7950 Marty St., but provides a new performance space, playground and enhanced green space within the park at 8045 Santa Fe Drive. The plan goes to the full council Oct. 1 for consideration.</p><p>“There’s a lot of things that we don’t have that we’ve been asked about over the years,” Park Services Director Greg Ruether told the committee. “What new could go into this location?”<br/><br/></p><p>The budget for the park improvements is $3 million and Ruether said the approved concept is designed to keep to that funding limit. Of the $3 million, $1 million is coming in a donation from retired car dealer Frank Thompson, a longtime philanthropist from Overland Park, and his wife Evangeline. </p><p>On Aug. 6, the city council approved an agreement that calls for Santa Fe Commons Park to be renamed Thompson Park once the upgrades are completed.</p><p>Amenities would include improved restrooms and shelters, a water feature with spray or mist, a contemporary children’s playground, natural play areas and space for table tennis, and a new open performance venue with a “paper airplane” shaped roof that would be a nod to Overland Park’s transportation past. </p><p>The conceptual plan was dubbed “Park Stroll,” by the Omaha-based RDG Planning &amp; Design landscape architecture firm, which came up with <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article213247329.html\" target=\"_blank\">four concepts for the city</a> to consider over the summer. Two concepts were for the park only, and two were for incorporating the farmers’ market into the park. Following several public forums and meetings with downtown business advocates and other stakeholders, Ruether said, the “Park Stroll” concept was the consensus choice.</p><p>It would preserve the existing Carriage House, which dates from the early 1900s, and keep as many of the healthy trees as possible. It calls for replacing the deteriorating bandstand and broken sidewalks and fixing or replacing other aging infrastructure.</p><p>Bruce Niedermyer with RDG said the southern half of the park would remain as open and natural as possible, to create an urban lawn, almost like a “front yard,” for the nearby Santa Fe Towers apartments, whose many residents cherish the park and didn’t want substantial changes.</p><p>Ruether said he had appreciated his meeting with the Santa Fe Towers residents, describing them as “the nicest and most opinionated people.” He said the debate over moving the farmers’ market had been polarizing, but it was a useful discussion, and the feedback from <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article213247329.html\" target=\"_blank\">well over 100 city residents</a> and other stakeholders had been crucial to the city’s decision on the best direction for the park. </p><p>Many people felt shoehorning the farmers’ market into the park would reduce the desirable green space while also cramping the market. Parking was also a concern. City officials have determined that improving the market at its present location honors its 36-year history and is the best option, although those construction upgrades will have to be phased in over time to minimize disruptions to vendors and customers.</p><p>Some residents now have a new concern: they’ve objected to the renaming, arguing it was done with no public input. They believe the Santa Fe Commons name should be preserved and is a better tie to Overland Park’s historical connection to the Santa Fe Trail. But the committee took no testimony on the renaming Wednesday night.</p><p>About three dozen people attended Wednesday’s public hearing, and several testified that they were relieved and pleased with the chosen concept.</p><p>“I think that can make a beautiful addition to our city,” said Linda McGuckin, who lives nearby.</p><p>Others questioned some of the elements.</p><p>“I treasure the fact that the park is natural,” said Rich Kaufman, adding that he thinks all the new park structures will detract from its natural character. He thought the “paper airplane” shaped roof for the performance space was silly and advised, “Get rid of that element. Make it a glider.”</p><p>Kaufman and several others also wondered why the park improvements need to occur now. They suggested the city should wait until multiple downtown construction projects are completed in a few years to see if park changes are really needed.</p><p>But Councilman Paul Lyons opposed waiting and said the city can coordinate the park construction with other projects to try to reduce parking problems and inconvenience.</p><p>“I think we should go full steam ahead,” he said. “I think it’s going to be a great amenity.”</p><p>If the council approves the concept, more detailed designs go to the Overland Park Planning Commission, probably late this year or early next year. Ruether said the schedule calls for construction in 2019.</p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">His approval numbers are underwater and his polarizing presidency is endangering dozens of House Republicans. But when it comes to motivating GOP voters, nobody is more effective than President Donald Trump.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After watching him successfully intercede in primary after primary this summer, Republican candidates now face an agonizing general-election dilemma: They need Trump’s help mobilizing conservative voters but worry that embracing the president might destroy their standing with independents in the process.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“His support among the Republican base brings a level of intensity that is unrivaled, at least in recent history,” said Ken Spain, a former top official at the National Republican Congressional Committee. “That’s the conundrum that many Republican candidates are facing across the country: how do you captivate and mobilize the Republican base while trying to win over independent voters? So far, that has been a very difficult balancing act.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Trump’s ability to move GOP votes when his name isn’t on the ballot was once in doubt. But this summer changed that, according to strategists, pollsters and donors who watched Trump endorse in a host of recent primaries, going on a winning streak in places as diverse as a congressional primary on New York’s blue-collar Staten Island and a gubernatorial primary in culturally conservative Kansas.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Citing internal polling, strategists involved in many of those races say Trump’s endorsements played a critical role in shaping the outcome — evidence of just how potent his support is with rank-and-file Republicans, even as it also risks galvanizing the other side.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“The ability to totally, single-handedly swing an election is kind of terrifying, but it’s reality,” said one GOP strategist who has been involved in several gubernatorial contests across the country, and who like many sources interviewed for this story declined to discuss internal polling and strategy on the record. “It’s the president’s party, at least for the foreseeable future, and we’re all just attending.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:216196330% --> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">In Kansas, on the day before the primary, Trump endorsed Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, an immigration hardliner and conservative who was running against incumbent Gov. Jeff Colyer. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The final vote count took days, and the Colyer campaign <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article216310205.html\">said</a> at the time that it had “consistently led in mail-in ballots statewide in this election.” But ultimately, Kobach eked out a victory—and political operatives who watched the race closely think Trump’s endorsement had something to do with it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“If you look at Election Day voting versus early voting, it obviously was profoundly different,” said the GOP source involved in governors’ races. “I don’t know what else to chalk that up to but the Trump endorsement.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On Staten Island earlier this summer, some public polls <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/06/04/grimm-leads-donovan-by-10-points-in-new-ny1-siena-poll-450692\">showed</a> former Rep. Michael Grimm ahead of incumbent Rep. Dan Donovan as each competed to be the most pro-Trump candidate. Trump sided with Donovan.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Where it really had an impact was with those who said...‘At the end of the day, the president says Donovan’s the guy,’” said a Donovan adviser who said the congressman ended up overperforming internal polling estimates. “That was the difference between a close race and what turned out to be a pretty commanding victory.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The numbers were even more stark in gubernatorial contests in Florida and Georgia.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The day that Trump endorsed Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp in a primary runoff, his opponent, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, plummeted, according to internal numbers from the pro-Cagle camp. He never recovered, dropping from a lead to a nearly 40-percentage point loss in a matter of days.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And in Florida, Rep. Ron DeSantis trailed Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam in the gubernatorial primary earlier this summer, according to <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2018/06/21/fox-news-poll-621.html\">some</a> data. But after Trump reiterated his support for DeSantis on Twitter—and the congressman played up the endorsement in ads—he pulled ahead, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2018/07/17/poll-shows-trump-endorsement-gives-desantis-an-edge-in-florida-governors-race-513549\">polls showed</a>, and he defeated Putnam by 20 percentage points last week. </p><p> <!-- %asset:212475459% --> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Certainly, Trump has also endorsed candidates who appeared to be ahead anyway. And in other races where he has intervened—a special election in Ohio’s heavily suburban 12th district, for example—the contests have sometimes been competitive largely because Trump has dragged down GOP candidates in the first place, and has motivated the Democratic base to turn out in anger.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Indeed, outside of primaries, Trump has endorsed in a host of special elections in traditionally conservative territory that his party has gone on to lose, from Alabama to western Pennsylvania, a warning for the general election that firing up the base, even with Trump’s help, might not be enough in a tough environment for Republicans.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“We’re going to learn a hard lesson,” said the GOP strategist involved in governors’ races. “I hope I’m wrong, but I think it’s possible we learn the hard lesson that a base is not enough to win a general election.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But for the many candidates Trump has boosted in primary season, their fates are now intertwined with his approval ratings as general election season arrives and they seek to court independents, said a major GOP donor who has been involved in races in which Trump has endorsed. After benefiting from Trump’s support in the primary, there is no avoiding that branding in the general.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Republican candidates are tied to Trump’s agenda and personality,” the donor said. “There’s no use for a Ron DeSantis or a John James [the Trump-backed Michigan GOP Senate nominee] to run from Trump. They need to embrace him and hope that he’s at a high enough general election number, which probably means around 50 percent, that they can then win on a localized race. But there’s no way they escape from him.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And they shouldn’t try, argued John McLaughlin, whose firm is involved in House races and who did polling for Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. He noted that the Republican-held Congress hasn’t followed through on core campaign promises such as repealing Obamacare, disappointing many conservative voters. To keep the Republican base engaged, candidates across the board need to tap into Trump, he said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“The Republican majority in Congress has not passed a lot of things that are popular,” he said. “That’s where the trouble is with reelecting House [members], getting more Senate seats. The president is picking them up, they’re standing on his shoulders.”</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\">Katie Glueck: 202-286-2392, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katieglueck\">@katieglueck</a></div><p> <!-- %asset:206361289% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kansas agencies now have more than 7,300 no-bid contracts worth $428 million — numbers that have more than doubled over the past five years.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The figures show that Kansas government has skipped the state’s competitive bidding process far more often than previously known. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article211437184.html\" target=\"_blank\">An Eagle analysis </a>of state records in May found that agencies had sought to skip competitive bidding at least 1,000 times over eight years. But a report from legislative researchers provided Wednesday shows Kansas has far more no-bid contracts. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Critics of no-bid contracts say that more competitive bidding would drive down costs and save taxpayer money. Proponents of no-bid contracts say that sometimes only a single company is capable of performing the work.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Researchers found the total number of no-bid contracts has grown by more than 4,500 since 2013. The total value of the state’s no-bid contracts has also risen sharply over that same time, from $160 million in 2013 — the low point over the past 10 years — to $428 million now.<br/><br/></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rep. Troy Waymaster, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, noted an increase of about 3,000 contracts between 2015 and 2018.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“That’s what is compelling,” Waymaster said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">For the Department of Administration, which assists other agencies in contracting, “competitive procurements are the standard rule and non-competitive bid contracts are the exception to that rule,” Secretary of Administration Sarah Shipman said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">It’s unclear how many contracts — both competitive and no-bid — the state has in total.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Shipman said she is confident that a large amount of the increase in no-bid contracts since 2009, when the state had just 1,587 such contracts, stems from accounting changes made because of a new financial management system adopted in 2010 and 2011.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The number of no-bid contracts issued is trending down each year, Shipman said. In fiscal year 2016, Kansas awarded 4,700 no-bid contracts, 4,000 in 2017 and 3,700 in 2018, she said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to legislative researchers, the overall number of no-bid contracts dropped last year for the first time in five years.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“We have been trying to drive the number of non-competitive purchases down over the last few years,” Shipman said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The state’s no-bid contracts began drawing scrutiny in May after the Department of Revenue said it planned to outsource dozens of information technology jobs. The changes are part of a no-bid contract with CGI Technologies worth upwards of $82 million over 10 years, the largest no-bid contract over the past seven years.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">During a legislative committee hearing on Wednesday, Shipman and Revenue Secretary Sam Williams defended decisions to award no-bid contracts and described the steps they must take before skipping competitive bidding.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Agencies must get permission, or prior authorization, for a no-bid process. For prior authorizations worth more than $100,000, a notice must be posted online that gives other companies a chance to protest the decision and potentially bid.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“The prices were challenged and re-challenged,” Williams said. He called the negotiations with CGI extensive.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">About 56 jobs at the revenue department are affected by the agency’s contract with CGI. Williams said about 20 of those people had taken jobs with CGI. A few others have retired.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ultimately the remaining jobs will disappear, but Williams told the committee there is no date for ending anyone’s employment and that the agency is working to find workers other jobs in state government.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">KDOR’s contract with CGI and the related personnel moves became public the day after lawmakers wrapped up the regular session this year.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“If that had been a week or two earlier, which it should have been, then we would have had the opportunity to ask the appropriate questions,” Rep. Kathy Wolfe Moore, D-Kansas City, said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Williams acknowledged he should have told lawmakers sooner.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Yes, ma’am. I agree with you,”Williams said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Waymaster said lawmakers need to do a better job in questioning agencies about their no-bid contracts.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Why did you enter this contract …how much is this contract costing the state?” Waymaster said.</p></div>",

Kevin Yoder of Kansas now says he no longer supports a Democratic plan to make it easier for migrants fleeing domestic abuse or gang violence to claim asylum in the United States.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yoder, who chairs a subcommittee responsible for homeland security funding, is facing a fierce re-election battle in a suburban Kansas City district that Democrat Hillary Clinton narrowly won in 2016.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Republican congressman from Overland Park, Kansas, told McClatchy this week that the asylum proposal “may be too controversial to make it through the process” and will be dropped.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It’s a striking reversal for Yoder.</p><p>He stunned Democrats and Republicans alike in July when he rebuffed a personal appeal from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and threw his support behind the Democratic asylum proposal offered by Rep. David Price, D-North Carolina.<br/><br/></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Price’s plan would forbid the use of federal funds to enforce the Trump administration’s stricter rules on asylum seekers. Yoder’s initial support directly contradicted a June Sessions ruling that immigration judges should not allow fear of domestic or gang violence as grounds for granting asylum.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Despite Sessions’ plea — and over the objections of legislative staffers at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and Customs and Border Patrol — Yoder spoke in favor of the proposal and allowed it to pass the House appropriations committee on July 25 by voice vote, according to three sources familiar with the discussion. The voice vote meant lawmakers didn’t have to record their support or opposition by name.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The proposal became part of next year’s homeland security spending bill, which also includes $5 billion for President Donald Trump’s U.S.-Mexico border wall. The bill is pending in the House.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yoder was chairing the House Appropriations Committee deliberation on the spending bill, and prior to the vote on the Price plan, word got out Yoder was a supporter.</p><p> <!-- %asset:215798865% --> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The news triggered a furor in the Trump administration.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Immigration staffers went to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s office and expressed concern about Yoder’s support for the proposal, according to a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When Nielsen’s chief of staff, Chad Wolf, did not act quickly enough to stop the plan from passing the committee, the same staffers approached Sessions’ office.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sessions made a personal phone call to Yoder’s chief of staff Dave Natonski, according to three sources familiar with the discussion.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the call, Sessions explained the implications of the Democratic asylum proposal Yoder supported. Yoder’s chief of staff responded politely that he understood.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But Yoder, who had just received a ringing re-election endorsement from Trump on Twitter, backed the amendment anyway.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yoder even delivered a brief speech before the vote to underscore his support. The congressman said he believed strongly in protecting women from domestic violence and that it should be a factor in an asylum claim.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services “should at least be able to look at domestic violence issues or other circumstances on the asylum claim,” he said. “And while I understand there are some people in the committee who have sharply different opinions on this, for my part, I’ll be voting aye.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The backlash was swift. <a href=\"https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article215656440.html\" target=\"_blank\">Conservative media personalities and publications accused Yoder of betraying Trump’s agenda</a>. Talk show host Laura Ingraham called Yoder out by name on Fox News Channel and on Twitter. Breitbart News, a right-wing website, published a series of scathing articles.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Price responded to Yoder’s reversal on Twitter Thursday, saying he was “extremely disappointed that my GOP colleagues are siding with Breitbart and Laura Ingraham over the victims of domestic abuse and gang violence. I plan to fight in every way possible to ensure my bipartisan provision remains in the final bill.” </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yoder acknowledged on Tuesday that Sessions opposed the proposal.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“His only issue was the asylum,” he said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The congressman downplayed his own role in adding the asylum provision to the bill.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I didn’t bring the amendment,” he said. “The Democrats brought that amendment in committee. We worked with the information that we had.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The legislation could be redirected to another committee after it is removed from the budget bill, Yoder said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“What we don’t want to do is open up an opportunity for false claims and so what’s tricky to do is figure out how legitimate claims, particularly on domestic violence, can be made without allowing opportunities for false claims to be created,” he said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yoder referenced “an allegation saying that <span class=\"il\">32</span> million would be able to make this claim now,” a figure that appears to have originated from a Breitbart post that simply added up the total population of three Central American countries.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“A lot of that’s overstated, but that’s an area where I think the Judiciary Committee might have to do some work for us,” Yoder said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yoder pledged that another provision he added to the bill “is not coming out.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">He said he will ensure the final homeland security spending bill will include language from his Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, which aims to reduce the green card backlog for highly skilled workers from India and China, some of whom have been waiting years for permanent resident status. The legislation would lift per-country caps for employment-based immigrants.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yoder said Tuesday he will continue to push for a vote on the bill on its own, but its most likely path to the president’s desk is as a provision in the homeland security budget.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A floor vote is unlikely before the November election, Yoder said.</p><p><span><br/><br/></span></p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\">Franco Ordonez and Anita Kumar of McClatchy’s Washington Bureau contributed to this report.</div></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">The Sam Brownback era of Kansas politics was debated again Wednesday by the man who largely wants to bring back the former governor’s tax cuts and the woman who helped lead the Legislature away from the conservative Republican’s control.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Republican Kris Kobach, Democrat Laura Kelly and independent Greg Orman clashed over policy in the first debate of the general election campaign for Kansas governor, with their views on tax and budget cuts showing major distinctions between the candidates.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach wants to cut income and sales taxes, along with the state budget, while Kelly, a Democratic state senator from Topeka, called for Medicaid expansion and a quality education for all Kansans and lamented the impact Brownback’s earlier tax cuts have had on the state.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I’ve never heard him tell us exactly what he would cut,” Kelly said to Kobach at the event in Overland Park. “Are we going to cut schools, are we going to cut foster care? Are we going to cut roads? What are you going to cut, Kris, to pay for your tax cut?”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Orman, who aligns more closely with Kelly on a number of issues, focused much of his energy in the debate on deriding how Democrats and Republicans have run the state when they’ve had control. He also called for “top to bottom” criminal justice reform.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The candidates traded barbs over what role state Supreme Court justices should have on school funding. Kobach supports a constitutional amendment that would largely remove the justices from the process, while Kelly was a hard “no” on the move. Orman said it didn’t make sense to have a constitutional amendment while the state is in the middle of a lawsuit concerning its education system.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The debate often found Kelly and Orman on one side with Kobach on the other, including on medical marijuana. Kobach said he opposed making it legal while the others were for it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">All three candidates agreed, however, for perhaps the only time of the entire debate, that they supported legalizing sports betting in Kansas.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The three candidates were critical of one another in close to equal doses.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">At one point, Orman singled out Kobach’s immigration views.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I almost think the idea, Kris, that you think that we need to get rid of all immigrants in Kansas, all illegal immigrants in Kansas, just disqualifies you to be governor,” Orman said. “It’s clearly a red meat issue for your base.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach, who defeated Gov. Jeff Colyer in the GOP primary, made a point of using his tenure as Kansas secretary of state as a sign that he is ready for a promotion to governor.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I’ve shown the people of Kansas that I deliver results,” Kobach said, pointing to his work passing voter ID laws through the Legislature early during his time in statewide office.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Each of the candidates was asked, “which action by the Trump administration do you support the most and which do you most oppose?”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach, long a Trump supporter who was endorsed by the president the day before the GOP primary, applauded the federal tax cuts pushed by Trump. But he opposed the delay when it came to reversing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the Obama-era program giving children who arrived in the U.S. illegally the chance to avoid being deported.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“President Trump eventually got there,” Kobach said. “I just would have gotten there faster.”</p><p>Orman said he appreciated Trump’s support for apprenticeship programs and technical education. But he said he was concerned abut the president’s approach on tariffs.</p><p>“Ultimately, I understand the strategy, but I think it’s a very risky approach” Orman said.</p><p>The harshest criticism of Trump came from Kelly, who said she had racked her brain for what she liked best and joked it was the attention paid to golf under Trump. </p><p>“I think the thing that I most abhor about the Trump administration is the divisiveness, the incivility, the xenophobia, misogyny that comes out of that administration on a regular basis,” Kelly said. “I think it’s tearing our country apart and I think we need a uniter, not a divider.”</p><p><!-- %asset:217887945% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Kerri Evelyn Harris keeps a photograph of herself with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez taped to a wall inside her campaign headquarters. She was standing next to it when she started to made bold predictions about the future of the Democratic Party.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“2018 is just the beginning,” she said of Ocasio-Cortez’s shock victory in New York over a House Democratic leader, a win Harris sees as only the start of the progressive insurgency against her party. “Every election cycle we’re just going to see more and more regular people running because they know they have the ability to serve their communities.” </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Harris is trying to do her part to make history on Thursday, when she takes on incumbent Democratic Sen. Tom Carper in Delaware’s Senate primary. Her chances of victory are difficult to predict: By traditional measures, she’s a clear underdog, running against a better-funded, better-known incumbent, who is seeking his fourth term in the Senate after also serving as governor.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But Ocasio-Cortez was once regarded as a longshot, as was another Democratic candidate, Ayanna Pressley, who pulled off a shocker of her own Tuesday when she defeated longtime incumbent Rep. Michael Capuano in Massachusetts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To many grassroots progressives and top Democrats, Harris’s prediction is the bigger question for a party engaged in a tense internal struggle over its direction.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Are the successes in places such as New York’s 14th Congressional District and Florida’s gubernatorial primary (where Democrat Andrew Gillum last week came from behind for a win) isolated to this moment — or do they signal a broader shift in the party where a flood of aggressively liberal, grassroots candidates are set to primary and even defeat Democratic incumbents across the map?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“This year has shown that candidates who are giving voice to those values can win even in tough races, even when they’re outspent,” said Joe Dinkin, national campaigns director for the progressive Working Families Party, which has endorsed Harris and spent on her behalf. “And I think we’ll see more of it.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Progressive insurgents haven’t mounted successful campaigns in many 2018 primaries — Harris, in fact, is the only serious challenger to a sitting Democratic senator this year. Even in a trio of open seats, in Nevada, Arizona, and Tennessee, establishment-backed candidates faced no serious opposition in a primary.</p><p> <!-- %asset:212486749% --> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Party leaders have watched most (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/16/17359188/kara-eastman-nebraska-2nd-congressional-election-medicare-for-all\">though not all</a>) of the candidates they prefer in battleground House races, those who will determine control of the chamber’s majority in 2019, win their primaries.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But House races in safer districts, including the ones won by Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez, have seen underdog progressive candidates win instead. And gubernatorial races from Florida to Maryland (where former NAACP head Ben Jealous is the Democratic nominee) to Georgia (where Stacey Abrams is the nominee) have seen the liberal candidate emerge victorious.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Harris’s own policy platform closely resembles those of these successful candidates, an agenda of liberalism that includes single-payer health care, legalizing marijuana, and ending mass incarceration.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The 38-year-old Air Force veteran and community organizer also supports abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, a policy that — even more than single-payer health care — unsettles party leaders who worry it will alienate non-liberal voters.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I see a bunch of people who are afraid to take on the fight, who are afraid to do what’s right,” said Harris, arguing that it was the responsibility of lawmakers to “educate the people you are serving” about policies they might disagree with.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Harris was talking in her headquarters here shortly before she would encourage about a dozen supporters to knock on voters’ doors on her behalf, a get-out-the-vote effort four days before the primary. Person-to-person communication by volunteers is about the only thing the campaign can afford. Harris said it hasn’t even had the money to conduct a single poll, much less run TV ads.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Harris has received help from Working Families Party, which has invested $100,000 on outreach efforts such as digital ads and direct mail. Carper, meanwhile, has spent $1.5 million this election cycle, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Harris went knocking on voters’ doors in a leafy African-American neighborhood here in the state’s largest city. She pitched voters on a message of ending mass incarceration, protecting immigrants, and raising the minimum wage to $15 — all while arguing that Carper has been in office too long to understand their needs.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">She even spent a few minutes talking with a reporter and voters about the movie “The Golden Child,” a 1986 film starring Eddie Murphy. A name printed on the yard sign of a local candidate reminded her of a character from the movie.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“The Senate needs to change,” said Devin Pulliam, a 20 year old who spoke with Harris at his front door about legalizing marijuana and restoring an immigration policy that protected from deportation the young people brought to America illegally by their parents. “And she seems like a minority, and you need that.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Harris, who is gay and black, says she doesn’t see her identity as a major factor in the election.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“It might sound bad to say it, but it’s the wrong white leadership,” she said. “It’s not the people we went to high school with, it’s not the people we work with. They have no idea what the rest of us are going through. And so we need that balance and experience. And we don’t have it.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Harris say she thinks she’ll win Thursday. The nearly dozen voters she spoke with Sunday were uniformly supportive, though it’s rare for voters to tell a candidate to their face they support the other candidate.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But she’s emphatic that, even if it doesn’t happen all the way this election cycle, the party’s powers-that-be need to respond to the progressive movement she’s now helping lead.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“And if you don’t, there are going to be more people like myself, and Ocasio and Abrams and Gillum willing to step up and take it on, and say we are going to create change with or without you. And that’s just going to be what it is.”</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"><span>Alex Roarty: 202-383-6173, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Alex_Roarty\">@Alex_Roarty</a></span></div></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>One Sunday in February 2016, Jenna Squires browsed some of Kansas City’s most blighted areas in search of a home she could buy for a buck.</p><p>The city had floated a one-time offer: one dollar. For one house. Just revive the wreck and make it a home.</p><p>Somehow, Squires and at least 18 other committed Kansas Citians have done so, often in amazing fashion.</p><p>In contrast to their achievement, a dozen other properties in the <a href=\"http://www.kcmolandbank.org/\" target=\"_self\">Kansas City Land Bank’s</a> “dollar house” experiment still languish in disrepair.</p><p>The 2016 dollar-house promotion created a community stir. Thousands of area residents inquired with the city. Yet even if the program were a smashing success — and local officials today say they’re happy with the results — all understood it would be just a speck of renewal in a city <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article94559112.html\" target=\"_blank\">pockmarked by 20,000 abandoned houses</a>.</p><p>Of more than 100 houses that the city deemed salvageable enough to sell for $1, fewer than 50 could be matched with suitors willing and financially able to renovate the buildings to code.</p><p>In the end, only 31 dollar homes sold. The bargain may have seemed a no-brainer for buyers with the skills and tools to repair a place.</p><p>Until you consider what they had to repair.</p><p>What Squires found on the 3300 block of Monroe Avenue resembled most of the other abandoned and dangerous buildings that the city included in the program: “The worst of the worst,” as the Land Bank’s Chad Erpelding put it.</p><p>The roof above the front porch had sunk into a V-shape that Squires — a Navy veteran who felt comfortable in submarines — wouldn’t dare venture under. Though most of the windows were boarded, an exterior door leading to the basement was wide open.</p><p>Human feces covered the floor upon which Squires has since fashioned a dining room.</p><p>“Definitely, this place was very squatted,” she said, referring to the many transients who took shelter in the once-stately house built in 1921.</p><p><!-- %asset:217717640; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p>Home buyers of all kinds know that moment during a walk-through when a certain feature grabs them — a kitchen island, for example.</p><p>For Squires, it was a small jack on an outside wall that indicated the house was ready to be wired for Google ultra-speed fiber.</p><p>Go figure. When Google Fiber came through the neighborhood some years back to provide gigabit service to homes, cable installers hooked up vacant, broken-down dumps, too.</p><p>Squires, 30, recognized: “With the internet and YouTube, you can fix anything!”</p><h3 style=\"font-size: 1.71429em;\">Rules and rebate</h3><p>Kansas City’s dollar-house program drew some 6,000 inquiries about properties so ramshackle that an initial batch of 140 buildings considered salvageable could only muster 49 applications.</p><p>The board of the Land Bank — which takes control of abandoned properties that don’t find buyers on the courthouse steps — approved 45 applicants for the dollar houses. Fourteen of those bidders never followed through.</p><p>For the 31 that sold, the Land Bank required:</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>that buyers be local;</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>that they prove they have their own financial resources to restore homes to a condition that frees the structures from the city’s list of dangerous buildings;</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>that property taxes be paid from Day 1 of the purchase;</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>and that somebody (preferably the owner) would someday live in the house, adding vitality to a neighborhood.</p><p>If all agreements were met, the buyer would ultimately receive an $8,500 rebate from the <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/development/article64597597.html\" target=\"_blank\">publicly held Land Bank</a>. That  is roughly what the city would spend to tear down a dangerous building.</p><p>One other thing: “We couldn’t do anything to help them” after the purchases were closed, said the Land Bank’s operations manager, Michael Patillo.</p><p><!-- %asset:217825665; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p>“We’re not getting in the middle of problems between buyers and the contractors,” he said. “If buyers ask (for recommended builders), we tell them to Google contractors.”</p><p>In some cases, buyers bailed out of their promises. And it wasn’t always a simple matter of reneging, said Patillo. </p><p>People financially able to delve into the program in April 2016, when applications were due, experienced life events that made it impossible to pour tens of thousands of dollars into bringing houses up to code.</p><p>Some lost their day jobs. Or lost partners who had agreed to help with the renovations. A few hired contractors who stopped showing up before work was complete.</p><p>A woman who bought a dollar house on the 4100 block of Chestnut Avenue fell ill and spent several weeks in the hospital. Her still-dilapidated structure likely will be forfeited back to the city for demolition.</p><p>The Land Bank held deeds of trust on all 31 dollar houses purchased, allowing it to reclaim property where progress hasn’t been made. Today, 12 of the houses have yet to qualify for  the city’s $8,500 rebate. Most of those houses likely will return to city hands for eventual removal, which could be years down the road.</p><p>But demolition won’t be necessary for a four-bedroom house on the 5800 block of East 27th Terrace, a winding, wooded road that dead ends at Interstate 70.</p><p><!-- %asset:217717670; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p>Laurie Schwab, a Lee’s Summit pianist and activist for the homeless, bought that dollar house. She cleared the weeds and restored the building’s exterior to something just short of miraculous, with new siding, an arched window and cedar-lined porch that leads to a red door.</p><p>After spending $26,000 — and that’s not counting two years of labor performed by herself and many friends, some homeless — Schwab hopes to open the home this fall as the “Red Door Refuge,” offering transitional housing for up to four folks at a time who need shelter before getting their lives right.</p><p>Providing a place for the homeless — “that’s always been a dream of mine,” said Schwab. Rolling up her sleeves to revive a run-down dive has been a dream, too, “ever since I was a teenager...</p><p>“When the dollar-house program came up, it offered me both of those things.”</p><h3><p>Saving the houses</p></h3><p>A residence near 57th and Olive streets stands as an enduring testament to what you can buy for $1 and convert into a home.</p><p>The A-frame with the white picket fence owes its existence to a dollar-house campaign that the city pitched in the 1970s.</p><p>The house was purchased back then by a cousin of Patillo’s, decades before he joined the newly formed Land Bank in 2013.</p><p>His cousin Eula lived there until she died recently at age 85.</p><p>“I remember a lot of Thanksgiving dinners over there,” Patillo said. “A house bought for a dollar. I thought it was so cool.”</p><p>In 2018 a similar success story is unfolding on the 2900 block of Indiana Avenue, home of Retha and Archie Jackson.</p><p>Retha grew up just down the road, a preacher’s kid. Her mother resided in the neighborhood until she died 13 years ago. So Retha and her construction-worker husband had grown a bit too familiar with the eyesore that Kansas City slapped on the open market for a dollar.</p><p>Actually, it had been years since they saw the house itself. It was hidden behind a mini-forest of junk trees and weeds.</p><p>Neighbors pitched in to help Retha and Archie chop down the brush, and “it was like, hey, there’s a real house back here,” Retha said.</p><p>Slowly, the house is becoming a home for the Jacksons. It still needs interior work (these dollar houses will always need work). But the Land Bank cut the committed couple the $8,500 rebate check knowing that city-funded demolition wouldn’t be necessary and the money would help them finish the job.</p><p>Retha and Archie have helped repair dozens of dilapidated houses. She’s a professional painter. Archie “can fix just about anything,” she says, and much of the assistance they provide comes at no charge. It’s part of a preacher kid’s dedication to helping those in need through her nonprofit, Community Project Focus.</p><p>“We’ve been putting other people’s needs before our own,” said Retha. While her dollar house is for now cluttered with construction supplies, it’s livable and no longer on the city’s dangerous buildings list.</p><h3>A $3,500 resurrection</h3><p>On Monroe Avenue, Navy veteran Squires has interior walls that need painting and, above the dining room table, an original chandelier that needs wiring.</p><p>But the major work is behind her — the removal of three tons of garbage, the replacement of gutters, the introduction of a kitchen, a heating and cooling system, and a colorfully tiled upstairs bathroom she crafted from nothing.</p><p><!-- %asset:217717625; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p>A historic preservation buff, computer whiz (she works for a Lenexa company building drones) and former construction professional, Squires is responsible for almost all of the work on the house’s resurrection.</p><p>She bartered for supplies, offering to provide her software expertise to the furnace installer, for instance, and relied on the internet to tackle projects beyond her grasp.</p><p>Total out-of-pocket renovation cost: about $12,000.</p><p>If you discount the $8,500 rebate she received last year from the city, Squires’ home was risen from the dead for a net $3,500.</p><p>And that’s less than what Squires paid to have professionals replace the roof.<br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:217717630; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p>But nothing has been easy, as every repair has led her to discover further repairs needed.</p><p>“It’s one step forward and two steps back,” she said. “But the better this place gets, the more I know it’s been worth it.”</p><p>Especially as she sees neighbors fixing up their houses, too. That’s what a speck of renewal can do.</p><h3>The future refuge</h3><p><!-- %asset:217717660; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p>When <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article117055368.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Star visited Schwab in the fall of 2016</a>, her work on the East 29th Terrace house had just begun.</p><p>For her it was love at first sight, despite the living room with a caved-in floor.</p><p>A fire years earlier, likely caused by squatters, had spread from the basement  up through the first floor. Firefighters punched a hole in the roof to douse it.</p><p>Yet Schwab was optimistic about her $1 startup. </p><p>“You’re taking something ugly and making it beautiful,” she said at the time.</p><p>Beautification would mean hauling and stacking hundreds of carved stones, each weighing 87 pounds, to shore up the plunging grade off the porch.</p><p>Recently in the nearly finished living room, Schwab threw back her head and laughed: “It’s really not just a dollar.”</p><p>Many dollar-home buyers were warned by the city that renovations could cost $30,000 to $40,000. (“We low-balled them,” said Patillo.) </p><p>Schwab’s project is being completed for less thanks to a cadre of skilled volunteers familiar with her leadership in <a href=\"https://cue.misitemgr.com/One%20By%20One%20Ministries\" target=\"_blank\">One By One Ministries,</a> a nonprofit service organization.</p><p>“They kind of saved me,” said friend and helper Tom Devine, an electrician and recovering drug addict six years clean. Now he wants to help save others. “I’m kind of paying it forward.”</p><p>In April, the city chose Schwab’s dollar house for a celebration marking two years of the program’s one-and-done promotion.</p><p>With local officials in attendance, Schwab cornered Mayor Sly James and others about her ongoing battle with the city to access a water main. Soon after the ceremony, water was flowing at the future Red Door Refuge.</p><p>In a gesture of appreciation for Schwab’s hard work, City Manager Troy Schulte dipped into his own wallet.</p><p>“He gave me my dollar back!” she said. “I didn’t even ask for it.”</p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Missouri’s top law enforcement official, state Attorney General Josh Hawley, avoided rebuking President Donald Trump Tuesday over <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1036681588573130752\" target=\"_blank\">a tweet that accused U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions of endangering Republican Congressional seats</a> by indicting two of Trump’s earliest supporters.</p><p>Trump said the seats were “two easy wins now in doubt” <a href=\"https://apnews.com/49d8684b7c274603b693ec83aafc7f7a/The-Latest:-Flake-slams-Trump&#39;s-Justice-Department-attack\" target=\"_blank\">because of the investigations</a>.</p><p>“Good job, Jeff,” he posted on Twitter.</p><p>The tweet appears to put political pressure from the White House on the U.S. Department of Justice to act according to Trump’s will rather than independently.</p><p>Hawley, <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article215418920.html\" target=\"_blank\">a Republican Senate candidate backed by Trump</a>, said laws should be applied uniformly, but stopped short of speaking to the Trump tweet directly.</p><p>“I can’t speak to those investigations. I’m not familiar with the details of them,” Hawley said at a campaign stop in Blue Springs. “Obviously, I would say ... that the rule of law needs to be applied fairly and equally, and that’s what we’ve tried to do in this state as attorney general — that’s what I’ve tried to do.”</p><p>Hawley’s opponent, incumbent Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill, called the tweet “outrageous” in a statement.</p><p>“As a former prosecutor, I find it outrageous and scary that the president would think that the Department of Justice should consider party politics when conducting an investigation. Prosecutors should follow the facts wherever they lead without fear of political interference,” McCaskill said.</p><p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-sessions-suggests-doj-hurt-gop-in-midterms/2018/09/03/7dfeb4e4-afdc-11e8-8b53-50116768e499_story.html?utm_term=.09575e64ee6a\" target=\"_blank\">faced bipartisan criticism</a> over the tweet.</p><p>At the same stop, Hawley called for civility as the U.S. Senate considers confirming Trump’s appointment for the U.S. Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh. He called disruptions in a Tuesday confirmation hearing and fiery comments by senators a “three-ring circus” and lamented the “embarrassing spectacle.”</p><p>Hawley accused senators of trying to “shout down one another” and “acting like children.”</p><p>“This kind of behavior in the United States Senate has just got to stop,” Hawley said. “Judge Kavanaugh is eminently qualified. He should be confirmed.”</p><p>McCaskill criticized chaos resulting from protests in the Senate hearing. </p><p>“This should be a serious hearing, and I thought all the protests distracted from that goal,” McCaskill said in a statement. </p><p>Hawley took the opportunity to keep pressure on McCaskill to vote in favor of Kavanaugh’s confirmation. </p><p>“Sen. McCaskill ought to stand up right now and condemn this juvenile behavior,” Hawley said. “She ought to call on Chuck Schumer to stop these antics and call on her fellow senators to stop these antics. Give Judge Kavanaugh a fair hearing, a civil hearing and then vote yes.”</p><p>McCaskill <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article216060300.html\" target=\"_blank\">met with Kavanaugh last month</a> ahead of his confirmation hearing and said she welcomed the opportunity to speak with him on a variety of issues and looked forward to hearing more during his confirmation hearing. She has not announced a decision to vote for or against his confirmation.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/23fb3e453a224b3fb0d6575ec926bced/Quarreling,-chaos-mark-Kavanaugh&#39;s-Supreme-Court-hearing\" target=\"_blank\">Democrats opposed to Kavanaugh’s nomination tried to put a stop to confirmation hearings</a> over documents about his past service that have been withheld by Trump’s White House and more than 40,000 pages released Monday night that senators haven’t been able to review. </p><p>McCaskill said senators should have an opportunity to review those documents, but Hawley called the concern “just another excuse to stall,” noting Kavanaugh’s previous public opinions.</p><p>“His views as a judge are hardly a mystery. He’s been on the bench for quite some time now,” Hawley said. “This is why I say Sen. McCaskill ought to condemn the clown show that was going on in the United States Senate earlier with this circus.”</p></div>",

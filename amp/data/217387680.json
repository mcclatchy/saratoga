That reporting code was also separate and distinct from about 1,000 new ExpressVote machines that Johnson County rolled out for the first time in the Aug. 7 primary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We did not experience any issues with the integrity of the new voting machines nor the accuracy of the vote tabulation in August,” Metsker said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eES\u0026amp;S officials said the reporting code caused extremely slow results because it was unnecessarily and constantly refreshing statistical data rather than actually processing the data.

Both Greenhalgh and Buell said paper ballot systems are two to three times less expensive than electronic machines and are more efficient and secure.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The problems that Johnson County experienced, both the long lines and the slow results uploads, could both be easily solved by using voter-marked paper ballots and scanners.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“ES\u0026amp;S individual scanners are used across the country without the upload issue of the ExpressVote scanners,” Greenhalgh said. “That Johnson County would not entertain the thought of returning the ExpressVotes and just getting tried-and-true scanners before the midterms is baffling. We know there will be high scrutiny of these elections, and their system is faulty. This makes no sense.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth Metsker and Weber argued that touchscreen machines with a paper backup are preferable. Weber said touchscreen machines make sure a voter doesn’t inadvertently skip a race or vote for more than one candidate in a particular race.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“This is really the best of both worlds,” Weber said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWeber said he is confident the new code can be certified by federal and state officials, possibly by the end of September, well before the Nov. 6 general election.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","seo":{"keywords":"Johnson County, voting machines, delay, glitch, Election Systems \u0026 Software, late results, primary, election, computer, Ronnie Metsker"},"_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/stories/217387680?publication=kansascity"},"home_section":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/2596","asset":{"id":2596,"name":"Elections","taxonomy":"News|Local|GovtPolitics|Elections|","web_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/","unique_name":"election","_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/2596"}}}},"home_publication":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/publications/kansascity"},"lead_media":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/images/217406385?publication=kansascity","asset":{"id":217406385,"file_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/z882vn/picture217406385/alternates/FREE_1140/Metsker.jpg","caption":"Johnson County Election Commission Ronnie Metsker.","credit":"rsugg@kcstar.com","photographer":"Rich Sugg","thumbnail":"https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/z882vn/picture217406385/alternates/FREE_1140/Metsker.jpg","publication":{"id":0,"long_name":"The Kansas City Star","short_name":"kansascity","time_zone":"","web_url":"","analytics":{"market_code":"","site_file":""},"_links":{"self":{"href":""}}},"modified_date":"2018-08-27T19:49:33Z","published_date":"2018-08-27T19:44:55Z"}},"related":[{"href":"/newsapi/v1/images/217406385?publication=kansascity","asset":{"id":217406385,"file_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/z882vn/picture217406385/alternates/FREE_1140/Metsker.jpg","caption":"Johnson County Election Commission Ronnie Metsker.","credit":"rsugg@kcstar.com","photographer":"Rich Sugg","thumbnail":"https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/z882vn/picture217406385/alternates/FREE_1140/Metsker.jpg","publication":{"id":0,"long_name":"The Kansas City Star","short_name":"kansascity","time_zone":"","web_url":"","analytics":{"market_code":"","site_file":""},"_links":{"self":{"href":""}}},"modified_date":"2018-08-27T19:49:33Z","published_date":"2018-08-27T19:44:55Z"}},{"href":"/newsapi/v1/videos/217400865?publication=kansascity","asset":{"id":217400865,"brightcove_id":"5827426592001","title":"Johnson County Election Commissioner confident November’s general election will be smooth sailing","description":"During a discussion Monday, Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker and a representative from the company supplying the voting machines, assure the public that the November general election will go much smoother than the recent primary.

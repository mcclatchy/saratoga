    "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n            <p>Johnson County will accept nearly 1,500 provisional ballots either in full or in part, but there is confusion about the status of some unaffiliated voters. </p>\n          </div>",
    "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Small numbers of ballots in Johnson and Sedgwick counties are at the center of dispute between the backers of Gov. Jeff Colyer and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach in a primary race that may eventually be settled in court.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kansas law allows unaffiliated voters to declare their party on Election Day and vote in the primary, but the supporters of the two Republican rivals disagree whether this law puts the burden on voters or poll workers to ensure the paperwork is properly completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">And the state’s two largest counties <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216489915.html\">don’t appear to be handling the issue uniformly.</a></p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker, the deputy whom Kobach has tapped to oversee vote counting in the historically close election, said in a news release Sunday night that “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216584870.html\">Rucker issued his release less than 12 hours</a> before the bulk of the state’s counties, including its two most populous, were set to begin canvassing, a process that will determine whether <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216446680.html\">thousands of provisional ballots count</a> in a race where a few hundred votes separate the candidates. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Brant Laue, Colyer’s chief counsel, argued in a letter Monday morning that Kansas law requires counties to accept ballots from unaffiliated voters regardless of whether the registration switch was completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Laue said on letterhead from the governor’s office.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Both Johnson and<a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\"> Sedgwick counties </a>voted to accept thousands of provisional ballots Monday, but a handful of ballots in each of the counties could be at the center of litigation if the primary fails to yield a clear winner after canvassing is completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach saw his lead on Colyer grow to 206 votes by 5 p.m. as more than 60 smaller counties processed their provisional ballots. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sedgwick and Johnson counties, which account for more than 40 percent of the state’s provisional ballots, will certify their new vote totals Tuesday.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Rucker <a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\">called Sedgwick County to complain</a> immediately after the county’s canvassing board voted to approve 14 ballots where an unaffiliated voter failed to check the box for party label. He argued with the county’s lawyer about the legality of their inclusion in the vote tally. </p>\n            <h3>Confusion in JoCo</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">In Johnson County, Colyer’s campaign staff left a canvassing meeting thinking that the state’s most populous county would be counting all unaffiliated voters who cast ballots in governor primary.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">But it appears that Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker misspoke on the issue, leading to confusion about which ballots will be counted when Johnson County does its final tally on Tuesday.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Metsker referred to questions about the status of unaffiliated voters who were wrongly told to cast provisional ballots at their polling places and said votes would be counted for 57 unaffiliated voters in Johnson County who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">After the meeting, The Star asked Metsker specifically whether this meant that voters who were told to cast provisional ballots instead of declaring a party would see their votes counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“That’s correct. We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Clay Barker, Colyer’s special assistant, took Metsker’s assurances as a sign that the county was not following Rucker’s guidance.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“It would appear to me that the county commissioners, with counsel from their elections commissioner and legal counsel, decided to ignore it and do what they’ve done in the past, which is count ballots because they show a poll worker’s mistake,” said Barker, an attorney who previously served as executive director of the Kansas Republican Party.</p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216595325% -->\n            </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The Johnson County Board of Canvassers voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 provisional ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations. The 57 ballots from unaffiliated voters that declared parties are part of that total.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">But the board also voted unanimously to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons, including 35 ballots for which a voter failed to declare a party.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach’s spokeswoman, Danedri Herbert, contacted The Star shortly after the meeting to emphasize the distinction.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“I just think it’s important to understand the difference because other counties are now trying to follow Johnson County’s lead,” Herbert said.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Ed Eilert, who chairs the canvassing board and the Johnson County Commission, said he thought the distinction between which unaffiliated voters would count and which would not was clear at the meeting.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Regarding the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t count, Eilert said, most were mail-in ballots, according to his notes.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“There’s a place on there if you’re unaffiliated to mark the party and they didn’t,” Eilert said. “That’s the difference between the two.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The canvassing board, which is made up by the county’s commissioners, also voted to accept 275 ballots in part. Most of these ballots are from people who went to the wrong polling place on Election Day. Their votes for all statewide races, such as the primary for governor, will count.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"> Colyer’s campaign referred to Laue’s letter when asked about the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t be counted.</p>\n            <h3>More scrutiny in Sedgwick County</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The issue of unaffiliated voters received more scrutiny in Sedgwick County.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sedgwick County Commissioner David Dennis said it would have been easy for voters to miss what he called the “tiny box” on the form.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">And Sedgwick County Commissioner Jim Howell said the voters would have had to tell election workers which party they wanted to join to obtain a ballot. He also said he thinks the election officials at the polls should have checked that the form was completed before giving a ballot to the voter. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Tabitha Lehman, the county’s election commissioner, remained neutral on the issue of whether the votes should be counted. But she did say she trains poll workers not to advise voters on how to fill out the forms because she doesn’t want them to be seen as encouraging voters to affiliate with one party or another.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The confusion for voters was scorned by Cille King, a co-president for the League of Women Voters of Kansas. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">If poll workers instructed the voter wrong, “I don’t think the voter should be penalized,” King said.</p>\n            <h3>Other counties</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">In 11 other Kansas counties surveyed by The Star that sorted through provisional and mail-in votes Monday, there was no question that previously unaffiliated voters’ ballots would be counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Rick Piepho, the county clerk and election officer of Harvey County, said unaffiliated voters should declare a party simply by going through the provisional ballot process.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“On the provisional envelope — at least on ours — there’s a box on there that says I’m declaring such-and-such ... party and we have them declare on there, so when they’re signing the provisional envelope they’re also signing that declaration,” Piepho said. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Most poll workers in these smaller counties asked unaffiliated voters to fill out a voter affiliation card or a voter registration card to declare their party, and they were given a standard ballot to vote in that party’s primary, clerks said. A few voters were asked to vote provisionally, which clerks attributed to poll worker error, but those votes were counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“They had to fill out a card in order to be able to get a ballot,” McPherson County Clerk Hollie Melroy said.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sonya Stohs, county clerk in Marshall County, said 18 unaffiliated voters at two polling places in her county were asked to fill out provisional ballots because of poll worker error, but they all counted. </p>\n            <h3>Postmarks and other issues</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Among the 898 votes thrown out Monday in Johnson County were four mail-in ballots that lacked a postmark or had an illegible postmark.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach’s office advised counties that these types of ballots could not be counted last week, which prompted Colyer to call on the state’s chief election official to recuse himself from the process.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Votes won’t count for an additional 59 people who did not provide photo ID as required by Kansas law. And 272 people registered in one party tried to vote in the other party’s primary.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">One voter died after casting a ballot, which prompted the election office to recommend the vote be treated as invalid.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“We only had one of those, thank God,” Metsker told the commissioners.</p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216341105% -->\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216340375% -->\n            </p>\n          </div>",

            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Kansas’ two biggest counties made different decisions on how to count some ballots from last week’s election, meaning that some Sedgwick County voters who messed up on a form will have their votes count, while Johnson County voters who did the same thing won’t.</p><p>The conflict only affects 49 ballots out of more 200,000 cast statewide. In an ordinary election year it probably would have gone unnoticed. </p><p>But this time, those could be critical votes with Secretary of State Kris Kobach leading Gov. Jeff Colyer in the Republican race for governor by only 206 votes at the end of the business day Monday. </p><p>At issue are disputed provisional ballots, which were cast by voters who tried to switch from no-party status to affiliating with a party so they could vote in the primary on election day.</p><p>State law allows that last-minute switch, but there is a form for that and some voters didn’t fill out the form correctly.</p><p>Sedgwick County officials voted Monday to give those voters the benefit of the doubt; Johnson County officials voted to toss the ballots out.</p><p>Those decisions affect 14 Sedgwick County votes and 35 Johnson County votes.</p><p>Overall, Sedgwick County’s election board voted to count 1,326 provisional and disputed ballots, adding them to the total votes from the Aug. 7 primary election. </p><p>The results will be announced Tuesday morning.<br/><br/></p><p>The most disputed were 14 ballots cast at the polls by unaffiliated voters who indicated they wished to declare a party and vote in the primary, but who failed to check a box indicating the party of their choice on the form.</p><p>The election board voted 4-1 to count those votes.</p><p>The board is by law made up of the members of the Sedgwick County Commission. On Monday, one commissioner, Richard Ranzau, couldn’t be there, so his seat was taken by Karen Bailey, the chief deputy county clerk who was appointed as substitute. </p><p>Bailey was the only “no” vote on counting the 14 disputed ballots.</p><p>Commissioner David Dennis said it would have been easy for voters to miss what he called the “tiny box” on the form.</p><p>And Commissioner Jim Howell said the voters would have had to tell election workers which party they wanted to join to obtain a ballot. He also said he thinks the election officials at the polls should have checked that the form was completed before giving a ballot to the voter. </p><p>Election Commissioner Tabitha Lehman remained neutral on the issue of whether the votes should be counted. But she did say she trains poll workers not to advise voters on how to fill out the forms because she doesn’t want them to be seen as encouraging voters to affiliate themselves with one party or another.</p><p>The decisions of which votes to count were part of canvassing the vote, a process that is usually ministerial and noncontroversial. But it’s been magnified this election because of the whisker-thin margin in the race for the Republican nomination for governor.</p><p>Immediately after the decision to count the 14 disputed ballots, Kobach’s assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker called to object, arguing over the legality of the decision with Sedgwick County Counselor Eric Yost.<br/><br/></p><p>Under pressure from Colyer and his campaign team, Kobach has recused himself from overseeing the election. He appointed Rucker, his employee and a supporter of his campaign, to act as chief election official in his place.</p><p>The ballots approved by the election board are now being counted by election office workers.</p><p>Many of those ballots will have to be counted by hand.</p><p>Results are expected to be reported at 10 a.m. Tuesday at the Historic Courthouse downtown.<br/><br/></p><p>While Sedgwick County has decided to count the disputed ballots from unaffiliated voters the state’s other major county decided not to. </p><p> <!-- %asset:216595325% --> </p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker apparently misspoke on the issue Monday morning, leading to confusion for the Colyer campaign and others about which ballots will be counted when Johnson County does its final vote tally Tuesday afternoon.<br/><br/></p><p>Metsker said 57 unaffiliated voters in Johnson County who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots would have their votes counted.</p><p>After the meeting, The Kansas City Star asked Metsker specifically whether this meant that voters who were told to cast provisional ballots without declaring a party would see their votes counted.</p><p>“That’s correct. We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied. “These are citizens. We train them. We train them hard. There were a number of problems at that location.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216610415% --></p><p>However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party.</p><p>“This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.”</p><p>But that doesn’t include the 35 other provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who did not mark a form to declare a party. Those votes will be disallowed.</p><p>The Johnson County election board voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations.</p><p>The board also voted to accept 275 ballots in part and to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons. </p><p>The Johnson County board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.<br/><br/></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"436\" style=\"width: 327pt;\"> <colgroup><col width=\"368\"

Jeff Colyer’s office as the feud between the two Republican candidates continues. </p><p>As county canvassing boards began to meet Monday to review provisional votes, Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker said in an email late Sunday that “there has been considerable public discussion regarding whether unaffiliated voters can participate in Kansas party primary elections.”</p><p>He then attached a series of legal instructions including that “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p><p>Under Kansas law, unaffiliated voters are able to declare a party at the polls, and then vote in that party’s primary. Kansas law does not allow for open Republican and Democratic primaries.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign late last week voiced concerns about unaffiliated voters who were incorrectly told by poll workers to cast provisional ballots.</p><p>The governor’s office argued in a legal opinion sent to The Star Monday morning that “Kansas law requires canvassers to look to the intent of the voter” in cases where a poll worker incorrectly tells an unaffiliated voter to cast a provisional ballot, rather than to affiliate and then vote.</p><p>“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Brant Laue, the chief legal counsel of the governor’s office, said in the letter.</p><p>Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, has a <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article216487350.html\" target=\"_self\">slim lead, 110 votes, over Colyer in the GOP primary for governor</a>. Roughly 9,000 provisional ballots are spread across the state’s 105 counties. More than 40 percent of those ballots come from Johnson and Sedgwick counties, where Kobach has appointed the top election officials.</p><p>After initially resisting calls that he recuse himself from duties overseeing the election, Kobach eventually recused himself last week and named Rucker.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign also has alleged that “many Colyer voters had difficulties finding his name on the ballot, were forced to vote on provisional ballots, or were turned away outright for unknown reasons.”<br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:216521210% --></p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Gov. Jeff Colyer’s campaign staff left Monday morning’s canvassing meeting in Johnson County with the belief that the state’s most populous county would be counting all unaffiliated voters who cast ballots in the primary for governor. </p><p>But it appears that Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker misspoke on the issue Monday morning, leading to confusion for the Colyer campaign and others about which ballots will be counted when Johnson County does its final vote tally Tuesday. </p><p>Metsker referred to questions about the status of unaffiliated voters who were wrongly told to cast provisional ballots at their polling places and said 57 unaffiliated voters in Johnson County who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots would have their votes counted. </p><p>After the meeting, The Star asked Metsker specifically whether this meant that voters who were told to cast provisional ballots instead of declaring a party would see their votes counted. </p><p>“That’s correct. We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied. “These are citizens. We train them. We train them hard. There were a number of problems at that location.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216610415% --> </p><p>However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party. </p><p> “This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.” </p><p>The distinction affects 35 other ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who did not declare a party and won’t have their ballots counted.</p><p>The Johnson County Board of Canvassers voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations. </p><p> The canvassing board, which is made up by the county’s commissioners, also voted to accept 275 ballots in part and to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons. The majority of voters who will only have their ballots partially counted went to the wrong polling place on Election Day. Their votes for all statewide races, such as the primary for governor, will count.</p><p>The board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign raised concerns last week that unaffiliated voters who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots would not have their votes counted.</p><p>Kansas law allows unaffiliated voters to declare a party on the day of the primary to vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary.</p><p>Assistant Kansas Secretary of State Eric Rucker issued a guidance late Sunday night saying that if “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p><p>Clay Barker, Colyer’s special assistant, took Metsker’s assurances at the Monday meeting as a sign that the county was not following Rucker’s guidance. </p><p>“It would appear to me that the county commissioners with counsel from their elections commissioner and legal counsel decided to ignore it and do what they’ve done in the past, which is count ballots because they show a poll worker’s mistake,” said Barker, an attorney who previously served as executive director of the Kansas Republican Party.</p><p>Kobach’s spokeswoman, Danedri Herbert, contacted The Star shortly after the meeting to dispute that all of these ballots were being accepted. </p><p>“I just think it’s important to understand the difference, because other counties are now trying to follow Johnson County’s lead,” Herbert said. </p><p>Ed Eilert, who chairs the canvassing board and the county commission, said that he believes the distinction between which unaffiliated voters would count and which would not was clear at the meeting. </p><p>Regarding the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t count Eilert said that those are mostly mail-in ballots, according to his notes. </p><p>“There’s a place on there if you’re unaffiliated to mark the party and they didn’t,” Eilert said. “That’s the difference between the two.” </p><p>The issue also came up during Sedgwick County’s canvassing meeting. That county’s canvassing board voted<a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\" target=\"_blank\"> to accept 14 ballots cast by unaffiliated voters </a>who did not check a box marking party affiliation. </p><p>Rucker called Sedgwick County to object about the inclusion of the ballots immediately after the county’s vote, arguing about their legality with Sedgwick County Counselor Eric Yost. </p><p>The dispute could wind up in court. </p><p>Brant Laue, Colyer’s chief counsel, argued in a letter Monday morning that Kansas law requires counties to accept ballots from unaffiliated voters regardless of whether the registration switch was completed. Colyer’s campaign pointed back to this letter when asked for a comment about the confusion in Johnson County. </p><p>“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Laue said in a letter on letterhead from the governor’s office.</p><p>The confusion for voters was scorned by Cille King, a co-president for the League of Women Voters of Kansas. </p><p>If poll workers instructed the voter wrong, “I don’t think the voter should be penalized,” King said.</p><p>Among the 898 votes that were thrown out Monday in Johnson County were four mail-in ballots that lacked a postmark or had an illegible postmark.</p><p>Kobach’s office advised counties that these types of ballots couldnot be counted last week, which prompted Colyer to call on the state’s chiefelection official to recuse himself from the process.</p><p>An additional 59 people will not have their votes counted because they did notprovide photo ID as required by Kansas law. And 272 people tried to vote in theother party’s primary. </p><p>One voter died after casting a ballot, which prompted the election office to recommend the vote be treated as invalid.</p><p>“We only had one of those. Thank God,” Metsker told the commissioners.</p><p><!-- %asset:216341105% --> </p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

            "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Kansas Democrats don’t yet know which Republican they’ll face in the general election for governor. They says that’s a good thing.</p></div>",
            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kansas Democrats are delighted by the continuing battle between Kris Kobach and Jeff Colyer in the Republican race for governor. The prolonged uncertainty over who will win the primary election effectively hands Democrats “buckets of free money,” they say.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Republican race for governor may remain undecided for weeks and potentially end in lawsuits. Democrats say the extended drama gives them a head start on fundraising and organizing going into the general election season.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“It’s as if the Republicans are handing us buckets and buckets of free money … it’s days their money isn’t being used to attack anybody,” said Chris Reeves, a Democratic national committeeman in Kansas.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans are downplaying the possibility the unresolved contest between Kobach and Colyer, the current governor, will ultimately harm them in November. But they acknowledge the standoff could slow fundraising on their side.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kansas Republican Party Chairman Kelly Arnold said the uncertainty about the nominee “makes it a little more difficult for the campaigns to raise money … until they know they’re the candidate.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“You’ve got a number of people … who kind of wait until after the primaries are over because they’re there to support our nominee,” Arnold said. “Many of them are still sitting on the sidelines waiting.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">On Friday, Kobach, the secretary of state, held a lead of 110 votes, according to his office. The margin will almost certainly change when county election officials begin sifting through provisional ballots Monday.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The final results may not be certified until Aug. 31. Recounts and litigation remain possible.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">“We want the Republicans to spend as much time as they need to while we’re out talking to voters about what the future looks like,” Kansas House Minority Leader Jim Ward, a Wichita Democrat, said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">State Sen. Laura Kelly easily won the Democratic nomination for governor on election night and transitioned into general election mode. She has said it doesn’t matter whether she ends up facing Colyer or Kobach.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“The longer the story is indecision, confusion, disunity on the Republican side, I think the better that is for Democrats,” said Ethan Corson, director of the Kansas Democratic Party.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans, on the other hand, are waiting for the vote counting process to finish.</p><p>Arnold called the unresolved race a “temporary obstacle” that the party will work around and said the situation won’t hurt Republicans.<br/><br/></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He said Republicans will begin attacking Kelly right away.<br/><br/></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“We kind of have campaign plan A and campaign plan A.1 depending on which candidate we have,” Arnold said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Political parties typically use the days following a primary to unite and mend relationships frayed during the primary campaign. Parties and campaigns also intensify outreach to donors and activists as they kick off the general election season.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But instead of unifying, tensions are rising between Kobach and Colyer, who became governor six months ago when Sam Brownback resigned.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Colyer on Thursday demanded Kobach recuse himself from providing advice to county election officers and said he had made statements on national TV that were inconsistent with Kansas law. Colyer also hinted at the possibility of litigation.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kobach said Friday afternoon in a letter to Colyer that he would recuse himself from overseeing vote counting but said the decision is symbolic because the counties count votes, not him. He named longtime deputy Eric Rucker to oversee the election in his stead, but the Colyer campaign said his appointment didn’t address their concerns about a conflict of interest.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kobach also said Colyer’s rhetoric risked undermining public confidence in the election process.</p><p><!-- %asset:216335185% --> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">An extended recount or legal process could damage Republicans if candidates become hostile toward each other, said Patrick Miller, a political scientist at the University of Kansas.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“That would cost them time and resources and any of that hostility that gets out in the media doesn’t help the eventual nominee. It doesn’t help heal the wounds that always occur with primaries,” Miller said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Given that Republican voters were sharply divided between Kobach and Colyer, Senate Vice President Jeff Longbine, an Emporia Republican, said Republicans must analyze the results to determine exactly what voters said and carry out a strategy based on that message.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“I think it’s extremely important at this point for the Republican Party to make sure that we are inclusive, that we are listening to everyone’s thoughts and ideas within the party and that we get that unification that we’re going to need to be successful in November,” Longbine said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite the current division, Miller said Republicans still have a built-in structural advantage over Democrats: independent Greg Orman. Miller predicts Orman will draw away Democratic voters.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orman, a Johnson County businessman, isn’t officially on the general election ballot yet. He turned in thousands of signatures Monday to secure a spot and is waiting on the secretary of state’s office to certify the signatures.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“(Republicans) can afford to have damaging events occur, or to nominate someone like Kobach who appears from the polling to be a weaker candidate than Colyer,” Miller said. “They can afford that because they have the opposition split.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orman has rejected the argument that he will only take votes from Democrats. He has said he will build a coalition of Democrats as well as Republicans and independents.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Asked Friday whether the current lack of a Republican nominee helps Orman, campaign spokesman Sam Edelen said that regardless of who the nominee is, “the choice voters will have in November will be clear”: between two career politicians or Orman, a businessman.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans say they’re ready to move on to the general election.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">At a GOP unity breakfast on Wednesday, House Majority Leader Don Hineman, R-Dighton, called on Republicans in all political races to come together.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“What we need to remember is what happened yesterday was an intramural scrimmage,” Hineman said. “What’s coming up is a varsity match.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

              "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Writers at the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and others wrote or talked about how Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes had had an incredible start to the 2018 season.</p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ amazing start to the season — 10 touchdowns, no interceptions — has helped the Chiefs to a pair of big road wins over the Chargers and Steelers.</p><p>It’s got Chiefs fans buzzing, and here’s the thing, members of the national media are also gushing over Mahomes. The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and Yahoo Sports all had stories about Mahomes’ quick start. I’ve included a snippet of what each person wrote and you can click the link to read the full stories, although some may require a paid subscription.</p><p>Here is what people are saying.</p><p>Adam Kilgore of the Washington Post wrote a story with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/09/16/the-nfl-belongs-to-patrick-mahomes-now/?utm_term=.3adf1cd21600\">“The NFL belongs to Patrick Mahomes now.”</a><br/><br/></p><p dir=\"ltr\">“His physical ability and phenomenal performances fail to encapsulate Mahomes’s place in the league,” Kilgore wrote. “He’s too physically gifted to be seen as a prototype — good luck finding the next mobile, 6-foot-3 quarterback who can throw it 70 yards in the air. But Mahomes — a collegiate product of the ‘Air Raid’ offense, a starting quarterback on his rookie deal, a triggerman for Andy Reid’s designs and a conductor of concepts taken from college football — is something close to an ideal of modern NFL quarterback. He fits into every way the league is leaning.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Reid’s schemes have become the model for how offense is played. Seven NFL head coaches once coached under Reid, including reigning Super Bowl winner Doug Pederson and the Chicago Bears’s Matt Nagy, whose creative play-calling would have been the talk of the league if not for Aaron Rodgers’s heroics last Sunday night in Green Bay’s comeback victory. Mahomes’s talent may have made him a star in any setting, but he landed with perhaps the best developer of quarterbacks and most influential offensive mind in the game.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kilgore concludes with this:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“And so Sunday may have only been a start for Mahomes. He will face stiffer challenges than Pittsburgh’s secondary, to be sure, and not every Sunday will feel like a glimpse into a fluorescent future of the sport. But through two weeks, Mahomes hasn’t only been the most impressive player in the league. He’s been a signpost of where the sport is headed.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Andrew Beaton of the Wall Street Journal wrote a story with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/patrick-mahomes-is-conquering-the-nfl-1537136770?mod=e2tws\">“Patrick Mahomes is conquering the NFL.”</a></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Beaton opened the piece by writing about the risk the Chiefs took in trading away Alex Smith, who had a great season, and making the unproven Mahomes the starter.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Two weeks into this season, it’s no longer reasonable to question if Mahomes is good, and it’s far more reasonable to ponder if Mahomes is great,” Beaton wrote. “That much was clear after his second consecutive monster game. He threw for six touchdowns in a 42-37 win against the Steelers—giving him 10 through the season’s first two weeks.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes, 22 years old, is now the youngest player in the Super Bowl era with a six-touchdown passing game. His 10 throwing scores are a record for the first two weeks of the season. But his eye-popping statistics, somehow, aren’t even the most jarring aspect of what he has done so far. That’s because somehow what he has done is less notable than how he has done it. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes has dazzled with heaves uncommon in the modern NFL, which has increasingly shifted toward favoring high-probability short passes over riskier and longer ones. Mahomes has taken that trend and blasted it to smithereens with the bazooka attached to the right side of his torso.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yahoo Sports’ Terez Paylor, the former Kansas City Star writer, had a column with the headline, <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/legend-patrick-mahomes-grows-chiefs-appear-found-qb-savior-013002515.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The legend of Patrick Mahomes grows as the Chiefs appear to have found their QB savior.”</a></p><p>Paylor mentioned the Chiefs’ past troubles against the Steelers and why Sunday’s win meant that much more in Kansas City.<br/><br/></p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes has shown it all in wins against the Steelers and Chargers, including a rifle arm, moxie and the ability to throw under duress and from different platforms. The Chiefs needed every last drop of his talent to come out with the win on Sunday, as Mahomes managed to outduel (Ben) Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh’s future Hall of Famer, who completed 39 of 60 passes for 452 yards and three touchdowns.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes’ numbers already look ridiculous on the surface, but his performance is even more impressive when you consider it came against a Steelers team whose reliance on a fire zone pressure – where five defenders rush the passer and while the others (including defensive linemen) drop into coverage — has vexed the Chiefs in all of their previous five meetings under Reid.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Paylor later added: “Time after time against the Steelers, Mahomes’ ability to keep his eyes up under pressure, scan the pocket and deliver lasers from different platforms and launch points made the difference. The Steelers even became so weary of seeing Mahomes defeat their blitz packages that by the end of the game, they’d started dialing back on the blitzing in lieu of dropping more men into coverage.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Do not underestimate the importance of this. It is the ultimate show of respect, one reserved almost solely for quarterbacks like Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady, guys who can use their brains and rocket arms to destroy the zone blitzes that naturally leave defenses thin on players in actual coverages.”</p><p>Finally, it should come as no surprise that Peter Schrager, who is on “Good Morning Football” on the NFL Network, was wowed by Mahomes on Sunday:</p><p> <!-- %asset:218530770% --> </p></div>",

Please remain calm. No unnecessary movement. Slowly leave the arena floor if you feel safer.

For this reason, AURA temporarily vacated the facility and ceased science activities at this location.”</p><p>Officials had said very little about why the observatory, near Alamagordo, shut down. <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/article218345090.html\" target=\"_blank\">Local law enforcement officials said the FBI was involved</a> in the closure — which the feds have not confirmed or denied — and the resulting lack of information led to all kinds of conspiracy theories.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.alamogordonews.com/story/news/local/2018/09/07/sunspot-observatory-south-cloudcroft-closed-due-security-issue/1227788002/\" target=\"_blank\">“It was our decision to evacuate the facility,”</a> AURA spokeswoman Shari Lifson said after the observatory closed, according to the Alamogordo Daily News. “I am actually not sure (when the facility was vacated) but it will stay vacated until further notice.”</p><p>According to the newspaper, Benny House, the sheriff of Otero County, said the FBI was involved in what he described as an elaborate shutdown process and said “the FBI is refusing to tell us what’s going on.”</p><p>“There was a Blackhawk helicopter, a bunch of people around antennas and work crews on towers, but nobody would tell us anything,” House told the Daily News.</p><p>He told the Albuquerque Journal his department got a call from “folks that work at the laboratory” who asked <a href=\"https://www.abqjournal.com/1219922/nm-solar-observatory-closed-authorities-mum.html\" target=\"_blank\">“if we could send a deputy to stand by while they were evacuating.</a> All the employees were packing up and leaving.”</p><p>Bureau spokesman Frank Fisher would neither confirm nor deny FBI involvement, according to the Journal.</p><p>The closing led people to wonder whether the closure had something to do with alien activity.</p><p>“Some say the evacuation could be part of a <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/mysterious-observatory-evacuation-stirs-alien-conspiracy-theories/\" target=\"_blank\">government effort to cover up a discovery involving aliens</a>, an impending solar flare or something else extra-planetary,” wrote the CNET technology website.</p><p>“<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9f8oyb/the_evacuation_of_the_national_solar_observatory/e5v1xjp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Others on Reddit</a> and elsewhere think the security issue may involve a foreign power attempting to use the observatory’s antennas to spy on nearby White Sands Missile Range.”</p><p>CNET noted that the U.S. military built the observatory in 1947, “when it realized the sun could interfere with radio communications.

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>After she says her male friend was suspended for wearing makeup, Jasmine Richards is fighting to change the rules for future students at her high school in Pearland, Texas. </p><p>“I’m really big on self-expression, <a href=\"https://abc13.com/education/alvin-isd-male-cosmetology-student-suspended-for-wearing-makeup-/4247380/\" target=\"_blank\">especially when it comes to being equal,”</a> Richards told KTRK. “I felt if girls should be able to wear makeup, then a boy should have no problem doing the same thing if that’s how he wants to express himself.”<br/><br/></p><p>Officials at Shadow Creek High School gave an in-school suspension to the teenage boy, who has not been identified, because <a href=\"https://www.khou.com/article/news/education/alvin-isd-reevaluating-ban-on-boys-wearing-makeup/285-593533499\" target=\"_blank\">he was wearing makeup while on school property</a>, Richards told KHOU. </p><p>Along with banning boys from wearing earrings and having hair that exceeds a “length touching the top of the shoulders,” the Alvin Independent School District’s dress code <a href=\"https://www.alvinisd.net/cms/lib/TX01001897/Centricity/Domain/281/Dress%20Code%202018-19%20as%20of%207.9.18.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">says that “boys may not wear make-up.”</a> </p><p>Richards said that rule is particularly unfair to her friend, <a href=\"https://abc13.com/education/alvin-isd-male-cosmetology-student-suspended-for-wearing-makeup-/4247380/\" target=\"_blank\">who is part of the high school’s cosmetology program.</a></p><p>“He does makeup every day in those classes,” she said, according to KTRK. “He also wears makeup on his own so he felt he should have the right to wear it to school like any girl would.”</p><p>So, in turn, Richards started <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/concerned-students-change-alvin-isd-dress-code\" target=\"_blank\">a petition on Change.org asking for a change to the school district’s dress code</a>. </p><p>It has received nearly 2,000 signatures as of Monday morning. </p><p>“A boy wearing makeup should not be considered any more distracting than a girl wearing makeup,” the petition reads. “These policies harm young boys by telling them that they are not allowed to participate in the same forms of self expression that girls are, simply because they are boys. </p><p>“This has to change.”</p><p>One person who signed the petition — identified as Parhis Arvie of Pearland, Texas — wrote that she supports changing the dress code to support boys who wear makeup because it’s a matter of equality. </p><p>“Why should certain people be prohibited from things when others aren’t,” she asked. “It is important for me to know that if my brother chooses to, that he will be allowed to wear whatever he feels comfortable in and on his own skin. This is not the 90’s anymore.”</p><p>Jennifer T, another person who signed the petition, said the same rules were around when she attended high school. </p><p>“These archaic rules were there in the 80s when I was in school nearby but come on!” she wrote. “It’s 2018 — we are striving toward gender equality. There should be no gender rules when it comes to dress code.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:217031410% --> </p><p>But not all residents seemed supportive of allowing boys to express themselves with makeup. A man named Luke Perry told KHOU that “if it was my kid, I wouldn’t want him wearing makeup to school.”</p><p>Daniel Combs, assistant superintendent of the Alvin Independent School District, said in a statement to Yahoo that <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/texas-school-district-re-evaluating-sexist-dress-code-student-suspended-wearing-makeup-class-184327043.html\" target=\"_blank\">he met with Richards and her friend to talk about the policy. </a>He reportedly said that “we started a great dialogue and allowed the students to share their insight.”</p><p>“As a district, we are going to put together a committee that will allow our community, our parents, as well as our students, to have a voice,” he told Yahoo, “and go back through the process to look at our dress code and, again, identify areas of concern and make recommendations.”</p><p>As changes to the dress code are considered, Richards said she hopes her actions can create a more inclusive space for the next slate of students. </p><p>“I want to leave with a more open and expressive type of environment if possible,” she told KTRK. “So I’d like to change that.”</p><p>In May, a Texas man said he was turned away from a bar in Kingsville because <a href=\"https://www.star-telegram.com/news/state/texas/article211024349.html\" target=\"_blank\">the security guard refused to let him in for wearing makeup.</a> Bobby Rodriguez said he drove 40 miles to dance at the Whiskey River nightclub, then was confronted by a “homophobic” bouncer.”</p><p>Rodriguez said he was allowed into the bar once he took it off. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.caller.com/story/news/education/2018/05/11/man-told-remove-makeup-gain-entry-corpus-christi-nightclub/603512002/\" target=\"_blank\">“I literally had to walk back to my car and rip my false lashes off and wipe off my lipstick,”</a> Rodriguez told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. “I was so upset.

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">A prediction: Arrowhead Stadium is going to be loud on Sunday. Really loud.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The unbeaten Chiefs will make their 2018 home debut Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers, and it will be the first home start of quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ career. Kickoff is at noon and the game is on WDAF (Ch. 4).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Having knocked off the preseason AFC West favorite Chargers and long-time nemesis Pittsburgh, both on the road, the Chiefs are likely to be fired up for the game, too.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In fact, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickMahomes5/status/1041445889510920194\">Mahomes tweeted</a> after Sunday’s win over the Steelers: “We are just getting started..! We are coming home #ChiefsKindom”</p><p>I’m providing a quick overview of the next Chiefs’ opponent early in each week, and here are five things to know about the 49ers, 1-1.<br/><br/></p><h3>Jimmy G</h3><p>The 49ers were a preseason darling thanks to quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo’s strong finish to the 2017 season after being traded from New England to San Francisco. The Niners won their last five games and many expected they’d make the postseason behind Garoppolo.</p><p>But in the 49ers’ opener, Garoppolo threw three interceptions in a loss at Minnesota. On Sunday, San Francisco beat the Lions 30-27 but Garoppolo dodged a bullet. Nursing that three-point lead late in the game, the Lions’ Tracy Walker intercepted a pass that was returned to the San Francisco 7. Garoppolo was bailed out by a defensive holding call on the other side of the field.</p><p>Garoppolo has completed 33 of 59 passes for 467 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions this season.</p><h3>Meet Matt Breida</h3><p>San Francisco running back Matt Breida rushed for 138 yards against the Lions and broke off a 66-yard touchdown scamper that was the 49ers’ longest TD run in four seasons. A big block aided Breida:</p><p><!-- %asset:218528265% --></p><p>Breida, who is in his second season after signing as an undrafted free agent out of Georgia Southern, has 22 rushing attempts this season for 184 yards. Former Washington running back Alfred Morris has 86 yards rushing in 26 attempts.</p><h3>Red Zone troubles</h3><p>The 49ers made five trips to the red zone against the Lions but had to settle for a field goal three times. Garoppolo was sacked three times on those three drives that ended in field goals.</p><p>Against the Vikings in the opener, San Francisco got to the red zone four times. Here is what happened:</p><p>1. Morris fumbled at the 1</p><p>2. Settled for a 33-yard field goal</p><p>3. Scored a touchdown</p><p>4.

Developers Eric Holtze and Whitney Kerr Sr. can’t possibly expect the Kansas City Council to go along with a plan to subsidize a high-end hotel when the community is just finally <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article217921460.html\" target=\"_self\">coming to grips</a> with its housing crisis.</p><p>And they can’t realistically expect there to be political will to allocate more in tax-increment financing when the community just went through an agonizing process over subsidies for the <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/development/article107783412.html\" target=\"_self\">new downtown convention hotel</a> just about a block away. Developers plan to sell $42.2 million in TIF bonds, coupled with $82.3 million in taxable bonds to complete the financing for that long-missing piece of our hotel lineup. Taxes that the hotel generates will repay those loans.</p><p>Toss a healthy dose of politics into these flames, and the prospects for “Hotel Bravo!” dim further. <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/steve-kraske/article218306545.html\" target=\"_self\">The first mayoral forum</a> took place last week with more than one contender expressing skepticism about approving TIFs for any project other than clearly blighted properties, preferably on the East Side. That’s why tax-increment financing was originally created.</p><p>It was mayoral contender and Councilman Quinton Lucas who pointed out that TIFs become massively unpopular every four years when candidates are running for office. This year will be no exception.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“I’d encourage the developer to sit down and renegotiate and think about a better package,” Lucas told us.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Councilwoman Jolie Justus, who’s not a candidate a mayor, said, “Clearly it would be wonderful to have those types of luxury hotels. But this is not the time to have that conversation.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Kansas City hotel market, which has gone from cruddy and outdated to fashionably well-stocked in seemingly the blink of an eye, might benefit from an ultra-sleek and wildly expensive four- or five-star luxury property. The location, across Wyandotte Street from the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts, makes sense for that select group of so-called “vanguard” travelers coming in from the coasts.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">So be it.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But Holtz and Kerr should regroup and repackage their initial Hotel Bravo! proposal with its sky bars and penthouse suites. Because as it stands now, this dog isn’t going to hunt. And it shouldn’t.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217291975% --> </p></div>",

Here’s what they had to say. </p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">It’s been a little more than three years since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage, and the <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article218257110.html#cardLink=row1_card1\" target=\"_self\">debate over LGBTQ rights in Missouri</a> is ongoing. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Star’s readers wanted to know: Should Missouri state law protect LGBTQ people from discrimination at work, in housing decisions and at private businesses?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Plus, we asked: What do you think the biggest barrier is in Missouri to extending such protections?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Here’s how members of the Star’s Missouri Influencer panel answered those questions. Most favored protections for LGBTQ people.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Kay Barnes, former mayor of Kansas City, senior director for university engagement at Park University:</b> <span>“Yes.”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The barrier: </span>Lack of understanding and thus discrimination against members of the LGBT community.</p><p><b>Michael Barrett, Missouri State Public Defender director:</b> “Rationale for denying someone a basic need, whether it be a home, a job, or health care should be based on criteria that can be applied across the board and does not target classes of persons. Quite simply, it should not be legal to deprive someone of such a need based on the way they look, worship, or love.”</p><p>The barrier: “fear of excessive lawsuits.” </p><p><b>Brenda Bethman, director of UMKC Women’s Center:</b> “Yes, there needs to be state-level (ideally federal) protections in place — otherwise LGBTQ people will continue to face legal discrimination.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: Anti-LGBTQ prejudice is the biggest barrier.</p><p><b>Mark Bryant, attorney and former Kansas City Council member:</b> “It is unfortunate but Missouri law needs to protect LGBTQ people at work, in housing decisions and at private businesses. Otherwise, LGBTQ people will be subject to the same types of discrimination that persons of African-American, Mexican and foreign national descent suffer. The United States is great because it absorbs different people from different places and blends culture(s) into something new. LGBTQ people are talented and innovative. We should prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.”</p><p>The barrier: “Survey polls do not indicate broad support in Missouri for laws which prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.”</p><p><b>Mike Burke, attorney and former Kansas City Council member:</b> “The short answer is yes. Missouri needs to enter the 21st Century in its laws on discrimination. A nondiscrimination law on a statewide level would send a message nationally that we are a tolerant society. Our cities have already taken a lead on nondiscrimination but without state legislation we are behind the times.”</p><p>The barrier: “We have too many legislators who feel they need to play to the lowest denominator in their base rather than the population as a whole.”</p><p><b>Thomas Curran, president of Rockhurst University:</b> “The promotion of human dignity and the pursuit of the common good compels us to have laws in the state of Missouri that protect all people from discrimination at work, in matters of housing and in private business. When this is not the practice, we need to create laws that specifically protect any and all groups who have experienced discrimination in these matters.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Tragically, we come across circumstances and situations where the promotion and preservation of human dignity has not been practiced because it’s not believed that we are all created equal.”</p><p><b>Jack Danforth, former U.S. senator:</b> “<span>I think that people should be protected from discrimination based on sexual orientation, except I think that the law should allow for businesses and organizations to practice their religious beliefs when their religion does not recognize same-sex marriage.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Until very recently, most people had never heard of same-sex marriage, and could not imagine that it could exist. This has changed dramatically over a very few years as more and more people, especially young people, take same sex marriage for granted. As the years pass, there will be increasingly less opposition to it.”</span></p><p><b>Reza Derakhshani, UMKC associate professor of computer science and electrical engineering:</b> “Yes.” </p><p>The barrier: “Bitter and and emotionally charged partisan rivalries, catering to unfounded fears rather than evidence-based research.”</p><p><b>Jane Dueker, lawyer, radio host and former political adviser:</b> “Absolutely.”</p><p><span>The barrier: “I think there are religious objections from lawmakers. Some business groups object citing the creation of new lawsuits. Similar to gay marriage, I think the legislature will punt and force the courts to do the right thing and then say ‘it is settled.’”</span></p><p><b>Gwen Grant, Urban League of Greater Kansas City: </b>“Yes. These people should be added as a protected class in Missouri law, which should include language specific to sexual orientation and gender identity.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span>The barrier: “We’re a conservative state and the legislature reflects it.”</span></p><p><b>Jason Grill, media, public affairs and crisis communications consultant:</b> “<span>No individual should face discrimination at work or in their job in any case no matter race, creed, religion or sexual orientation.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Current political makeup and numbers in the Missouri General Assembly, as well as some viewpoints that private businesses can do what they choose and should not be regulated in this manner by the government.”</span></p><p><b>John Hancock, former chairman of Missouri Republican Party: </b>“<span>Nobody should be for discrimination.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Two potential hurdles: One is the need to respect religious conscience. The second is a reluctance to increase the amount of litigation.”</span></p><p><b>Deb Hermann, CEO of Northland Neighborhoods, Inc.: </b>“Yes.”</p><p>The barrier: “The House passed HB2100 last session — a good step. However, I am unsure of the governor’s action on this legislation. It needs to be approved. Ignorance inflamed by political rhetoric causes great damage to this cause.”</p><p><b>Bob Holden, former governor:</b> “Yes. If we want to achieve our best economic and social status we must become more inclusive.”</p><p>The barrier: “Lack of understanding and in some cases awareness.”</p><p><b>Sly James, mayor of Kansas City:</b> “Missouri law should protect all people from discrimination and in the decisions and circumstances that affect their lives. Neither the Bill of Rights, nor the Constitution of either the United States or the State of Missouri include the phrase ‘unless you are gay’ in the texts. Our history should be enough to remind us that discrimination comes to no good end.”</p><p>The barrier: “Political ideologies that pander to a group of citizens who, for religious or other reasons, do not see the LGBTQ community as complete and equal humans. The ideologies tend to view this segment of the electorate as a voting block to be pursued and won.”</p><p><b>Jolie Justus, Kansas City councilwoman:</b> “Yes.” </p><p>The barrier: “Leadership in the Missouri House and Senate and the Missouri Chamber of Commerce”</p><p><b>Gregg Keller, principal of Atlas Strategy Group:</b> “This is a worthwhile discussion to have as soon as, but not before, the political left settles upon a definition of gender identity that goes beyond how a given individual feels they ‘identify’ on any given day.”</p><p>The barrier: “The political left coming up with a coherent definition of the terms involved.”</p><p><b>Crosby Kemper III, director of the Kansas City Public Library, co-founder of the Show-Me Institute:</b> “As an employer in more than one field in my career, I have always been interested in hiring the best people regardless of what goes on in their private lives (if legal and not disturbing to the institutions’ customers or colleagues). I would resist adding special classes of protection beyond all the already powerful anti-discrimination laws. That said I’m open to evidence that such discrimination is a serious problem which needs legal redress.”</p><p><span>The barrier: “See above.”</span></p><p><b>Jennifer Lowry, chief toxicologist at Children’s Mercy Hospital:</b> “Absolutely! It is unfathomable to me that in 2018 we continue to have this conversation. All people deserve to work. All people deserve to have a home. All people deserve to walk into a business and be treated the same as any other person. Sex and gender of an individual is not a public discussion. It is personal to that individual and should not be judged by others. Those businesses who have employment opportunities should hire a person based on their ability to perform the job. Those who have housing to rent or sell should be proud that any person wants to live in that home. Those who have businesses that want to make a living should be happy to sell their product to those who want to enter their establishment. If we agree that sex and gender are protected, then so should the community that wears it proudly.”<br/><br/></p><p><span>The barrier: “The largest barrier to extending protections to the LGBTQ community are those who use religion to justify actions against those that make them uncomfortable. However, our constitution requires the separation of church and state and, thus, religion cannot be used as a basis for establishing law. Most importantly, however, most religious teachings, if the constitution allowed it to be considered, would promote kindness and love over hate and fear.”</span></p><p><b>Quinton Lucas, Kansas City Council member:</b> “<span>It’s unconscionable that Missouri law does not already protect LGBTQ persons from discrimination at work, in housing, and in private business. We should join the rest of the country and give our citizens all rights.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Bigotry remains our biggest barrier to extending rights to all persons.”</span></p><p><b>Dianne Lynch, president of Stephens College:</b> “Missouri needs the most talented, innovative and committed workforce it can attract and retain if it’s going to be competitive. That means it needs to be as inclusive and respectful of individual and privacy rights as the markets with which it is competing for talent. This isn’t a personal values question; it’s a business decision. So the answer in the best interests of all Missourians is: Yes. Absolutely. Without a doubt.”</p><p>The barrier: “There’s a blurring of the lines between personal values and beliefs, and economic analyses about what is likely to best serve all Missourians. Our leaders can respect the personal beliefs of all constituents and still support legislation that expands the state’s talent pool, markets and partnerships with those who don’t share those beliefs.”</p><p><b>Christopher Maples, interim chancellor of the Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology:</b> “Missouri state law should protect LGBTQ people from discrimination at work, in housing decisions, and at private businesses.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “The biggest barrier to Missouri extending protections to LGBTQ people may be the reticence of elected officials to introduce legislation that may be viewed as being in opposition to religious views held by some of their constituents.”</p><p><b>Richard Martin, director of governmental affairs at JE Dunn Construction:</b> “If there is not current law that protects the LGBTQ community from discrimination in housing, employment and their freedom to pursue economic opportunities without obstacles based on their sexual identity. Then yes.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Perhaps it’s in the state’s DNA to be more like a follower than a leader on progressive social issues.”</p><p><b>Jay Nixon, former governor:</b> “<span>Absolutely. Our state must lead on vital civil rights issues, and be a welcoming place to work and live.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “The major business interests and groups must prioritize this as ‘workforce’ development.”</span></p><p><b>Ken Novak, UMKC professor of criminal justice and criminology:</b> “State law should protect the LGBTQ community from discriminatory practices at work and other forums. LGBTQ is a protected class and citizens should expect the same legal protection from discriminatory behavior as gender, race, ethnicity, age, veteran status, etc. But beyond the legal implications — it’s just the right thing to do. That should be sufficient justification alone.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Like many protected classes the LGBTQ community comprises a small portion of the population — clearly the minority. Legislators, as well as citizens, likely have less familiarity with people in this community or the unique barriers they face, and, as such, (don’t prioritize) safeguards to mitigate discriminatory practices. Protection may be triaged as a lower priority (if it is a priority at all).”</p><p><b>CiCi Rojas, partner and president of Tico Productions and Tico Sports:</b> “In general, yes.” </p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Businesses or organizations who may have religious or bias that prohibit them.”</p><p><b>Leland Shurin, attorney, vice president Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners:</b> “Absolutely. I am amazed, disappointed and angered that it would still be a question/issue in Missouri at this time.”</p><p>The barrier: “The use by so many politicians of unreasonable fear as a political wedge issue and the erroneous interpretation of religious principles.”</p><p><b>Ryan Silvey, Missouri Public Service commissioner, former state senator: </b>“<span>Yes”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “There is a philosophical concern by several in the legislature with creating additional protected classes for any reason.”</span></p><p><b>Jeff Simon, managing partner, Husch Blackwell:</b> “Yes.” </p><p><span>The barrier: “A philosophical concern about over-regulation by government, combined with a lingering prejudice against gays among some.”</span></p><p><b>Phil Snowden, member of University of Missouri Board of Curators: </b>“<span>Yes. Yes. We’re all people and all in this together. We should have equal rights.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Sometimes movements take shape and the right course of action doesn’t evolve for years. This may not be the hottest issue to push in Missouri but the state is headed in the right direction.”</span></p><p><b>David Steelman, attorney, former state legislator, chairman of the University of Missouri Board of Curators:</b> “Yes.” </p><p>The barrier: “All reasonable people should agree that discrimination is wrong and should be discouraged. However, the details of the remedy are always more important than is realized. It is important the legislation not be unduly restrictive of religious freedom or freedom of association.”</p><p><b>Maurice Watson, partner at Husch Blackwell law firm: </b>“<span>Protections in Missouri are needed and overdue.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “There’s hope in the tolerant attitudes of younger people who are now of voting age.”</span></p><p><b>Pam Whiting, vice president for communications, Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce:</b> “<span>Absolutely.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: While attitudes and understanding continue to evolve, we still have a long way to go. SJR 39 came close to passage two years ago, but was narrowly defeated, which gives me hope, though similar bills have been introduced in the legislature the past two years. Thankfully, they didn’t go anywhere.</span></p></div>",

The effort has gone by the moniker MONA — the Missouri Nondiscrimination Act.</p><p>A consensus is building, no doubt: On the general point of gay, lesbian or transgender persons needing legal cover from losing jobs or potential homes on the sole basis of their sexual selves, The Kansas City Star’s panel of business leaders, policymakers, community catalysts and opinion shapers —<a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/influencers/\" target=\"_blank\"> “The Missouri Influencers” —</a> speak almost in a singular voice:</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>“Absolutely!” on the necessity for LGBTQ protections, said Jennifer Lowry, chief toxicologist at Children’s Mercy Hospital. “It is unfathomable to me that in 2018 we continue to have this conversation.”</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>“Absolutely,” echoed Pam Whiting, vice president for communications for the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>“An emphatic ‘YES’” to MONA, wrote former Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes, now at Park University, in response to a brief survey to Influencers on the issue.</p><p>But ask about the details: How exactly do we get there — ensuring that civil rights are equal between those LGBTQ and those not, in all matters public or private? Then some opinions waiver.</p><p>The Missouri Influencer Series brings together readers of The Star and 51 high-profile Missourians for conversations about the most pressing matters confronting the state. Asked about LGBTQ issues, readers in an online survey rated as their top question whether the state should extend legal protections to LGBTQ people at work, in housing decisions and in private businesses.</p><p>Of more than <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article218408650.html#storylink=mainstage\" target=\"_blank\">30 Influencers who weighed in on that question</a>, many allowed that difficult but realistic challenges stir in the details. </p><p>Who prevails, for example, when someone’s sexual orientation clashes with the biblical beliefs of a faith-based employer or adoption agency, wedding planner, university or service providers to the aged?</p><p>Or, how should society settle tensions that arise when schools provide special restroom privileges for pupils transitioning to the gender with which they identify?</p><p>That riddle is now being weighed by the Missouri Supreme Court, which could rule by Election Day on <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article209799884.html\" target=\"_blank\">a locker room dispute in the Blue Springs School District.</a></p><p>The primary beachheads in Missouri and much of the nation are courtrooms considering, case by case, matters pitting religious liberties, personal privacy and the meaning of equal protection. </p><p>In a yet another case being mulled by the Missouri Supreme Court, a gay man working for the state Department of Social Services said he was treated poorly because he lacked “stereotypical attributes of how a male should appear and behave.” Missouri’s Human Rights Commission rejected his case after ruling that the worker was claiming discrimination on sexual orientation rather than on his sex, or gender, and thus he was not in a protected class under state law. </p><p>An appeals court ruled in the man’s favor and the state appealed.</p><p>“There are still many people not there with us,” said Kansas City Councilwoman Jolie Justus.</p><p>She was the first openly gay person to win a state Senate seat 12 years ago. </p><p>Despite enormous strides in LGBTQ acceptance since then, Justus said, Missourians in many communities can still be fired for setting on their office desk a portrait of a same-sex spouse.</p><h3>Equal protection</h3><p>Sharpest on the radar of gay-rights issues in Missouri is potential passage of a bill that would protect what groups increasingly call “LGBTQ” persons from discrimination in employment and housing.</p><p>(Just this summer the St. Louis-based advocacy group<a href=\"https://promoonline.org/news/we-are-adding-the-q/\" target=\"_blank\"> PROMO added to the LGBT designation the letter “Q”</a> , for queer, signifying a proud stance of many in the movement, especially millennials, to project more inclusive lifestyles over specific categories of sexuality.)</p><p>Regarding job discrimination, push-back groups include the Associated Industries of Missouri, representing hundreds of companies. Ray McCarty, the group’s president and CEO, told The Star, “We oppose legislation that sets up new ways of suing employers.”</p><p>The concern over creating grounds for too many lawsuits is expressed by some Kansas City area Influencers, as well. </p><p>“I would resist adding special classes of protection beyond the already powerful anti-discrimination laws,” said Crosby Kemper III, director of the Kansas City Public Library. “That said, I’m open to evidence that such discrimination is a serious problem which needs legal redress.”</p><p>Missouri House Rep. Greg Razer, a Kansas City Democrat, is trying. He said he and a Republican colleague — the only openly gay members of the legislature — are encountering growing support from legislators to approve LGBTQ protections after 20 years of dodging the Missouri Nondiscrimination Act.</p><p>In May, Razer’s bill <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article211342324.html\" target=\"_blank\">won 6-0 approval from a state legislative committee</a> — just the second time a committee cleared a MONA measure since the movement took off. “That’s as far as we got,” Razer said. “And sadly, that was a victory.”</p><p>But he expressed confidence that anti-discrimination forces finally have enough backing from Missouri lawmakers — including many older Republicans once opposed — that a resubmitted bill may quickly become law after legislators convene in January.</p><p>“I feel like at any moment the floodgate on this issue is going to open,” Razer said. </p><p>He noted that <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article212688674.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, voted as a state senator</a> in 2013 for one version of the Missouri Nondiscrimination Act. </p><p>No such measure became law this year, as legislative leaders who have come around on MONA were cautious not to rile conservative voter bases in 2018 elections. But Razer said that he has heard enough support from both sides of the political aisle that passage is closer than ever before.</p><p>John Hancock, a political consultant who for many years headed the Missouri GOP, agreed.</p><p>With conditions.</p><p>“If it’s written narrowly enough” so as not to impose on the rights on faith-based employers who might “object out of conscience,” then many conservatives will support the legislation, Hancock said.</p><p> “As a matter of general principle,” he added, “nobody should be for discrimination.”</p><p>Kansas City, Jackson and St. Louis counties and a dozen other Missouri cities have local ordinances that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. But for LGBTQ persons facing unfair treatment at work or in obtaining housing, “to use just a city law to get the protections they need isn’t enough,” Justus said. </p><p>She said it’s time for the state to extend protections it has long carved into law for classes of race, age, religion, sex and the disabled. </p><h3>Schools and gender ID</h3><p>On another front, Missouri public school districts are quickly confronting, one by one, a push in some communities for “gender-neutral” bathrooms.</p><p>When classes opened last month in the North Kansas City School District, students and parents seemed to welcome fully enclosed <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article216439305.html\" target=\"_self\">single-occupancy stalls</a> at two new grade schools, two sixth-grade centers and North Kansas City High School. Signage on the rooms feature male and female figures, providing private and more comfortable accommodations for students regardless of their gender identity, school officials told The Star.</p><p>In Blue Springs, a legal showdown ensued in 2016 when school administrators denied a transgender student’s request to use male locker room facilities. </p><p>Attorneys for the teen — identified as “RMA” in court documents — argue the pupil was discriminated against on sex-based grounds, a violation of the Missouri Human Rights Act. The school district counters that the law’s definition of “sex” doesn’t apply to RMA’s request. </p><p>A Jackson County judge and the Missouri Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the district. A state supreme court decision is expected in the fall.</p><p>Across Missouri, “we’ve had school districts quietly working with transgender students for a while, and nobody’s even noticed,” said Kelli Hopkins, associate executive director for the Missouri School Board Association. “Most district don’t draw a line until it comes to locker rooms and bathrooms.</p><p>“As cases are going up through the courts, you’re getting different results...We recommend that (schools) do whatever you can to accommodate all students.”</p><p>Transgender accommodations, in schools and the workplace, will continue to evolve, said attorney Maurice Watson, who heads a diversity and inclusion committee at the Husch Blackwell law firm.</p><p>Watson, an Influencer, said he has sat in meetings with local corporations attended by prominent transgender employees young and old.</p><p>“They may not be on the corporate board, but these are people in visible positions at their firms,” Watson said. “They are present and they are proud.” <br/><br/></p><h3>Religious freedoms</h3><p>Many of The Star’s Influencers referenced a need to respect religious freedoms while affirming LGBTQ rights and legal protections.</p><p>Former U.S. Sen. Jack Danforth: “I think that people should be protected from discrimination based on sexual orientation, except I think that the law should allow for businesses and organizations to practice their religious beliefs when their religion does not recognize same-sex marriage.”</p><p>Former state legislator David Steelman, chairman of the University of Missouri Board of Curators: “All reasonable people should agree that discrimination is wrong and should be discouraged. </p><p>“However, the details of the remedy are always more important than is realized. It is important the legislation not be unduly restrictive of religious freedom or freedom of association.”</p><p>Lawyer and radio host Jane Dueker questioned whether the statehouse ever will agree on a resolution: “Similar to gay marriage, I think the legislature will punt and force the courts to do the right thing then say, ‘it is settled.’”</p><p>Wouldn’t be a first for Jefferson City. </p><p>“Perhaps it’s in the state’s DNA,” said Influencer Richard Martin, of JE Dunn Construction, “to be more like a follower than a leader on progressive issues.”</p><p><span><br/><br/></span></p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\">The Star’s Allison Kite contributed this report.</div><p>Previous survey: <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article217982680.html\" target=\"_blank\">Organized labor</a></p><p>Next survey: Minimum wage</p><h3>We want to hear from you</h3><p>Initiative petitions have put minimum wage hikes on ballots across the country in recent years, and this year, Missourians will vote this fall on whether to raise the minimum rate to $12 per hour.

    "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Faulty software code was to blame for an overnight delay in Johnson County’s primary election night results, an embarrassing ordeal that <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article216290855.html\" target=\"_blank\">kept people across the country waiting</a> for the outcome to several high-profile Kansas races.</p><p>“The slow reporting of results was unacceptable and we apologize,” Tom Burt, president and CEO of Election Systems &amp; Software, said in a statement Monday. “We know the election office and other Johnson County government leaders put their faith in us and we let down our valued partners.”</p><p>Burt went on to say that the Omaha-based company, the county’s elections vendor, has rewritten the portion of the code that caused the delay and initial tests of that new code were successful. He said testing will continue so the new software can be certified prior to the general election.</p><p>Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker said Monday that he continues to have faith in ES&amp;S, and he is confident the problem won’t repeat itself in the November general election. Metsker was the prime mover behind the Johnson County Commission’s decision <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article210791069.html\" target=\"_blank\">to spend $10.5 million this summer</a> on this new system of voting machines and software.<br/><br/></p><p>It was the first time this particular system configuration was deployed anywhere in the country. ES&amp;S officials said other communities will soon deploy the same system configuration but they couldn’t provide a list of those customers.</p><p>Election results from the primary election were expected before 10 p.m. Aug. 7 in Johnson County, and those results were especially anticipated for the races for Kansas governor and the Kansas Third Congressional District.</p><p>Instead, final unofficial election results were not released until 8 a.m. on Aug. 8. In addition to the slow reporting of results, Johnson County also experienced <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article216316320.html\" target=\"_blank\">long lines at some of its polling places</a> on election day due to an unusually high turnout and voters who were unaccustomed to a new kind of touchscreen machine.</p><p>ES&amp;S officials said the uploading of tallied votes did not perform as expected on election night, nor as tested prior to the election.</p><p>“While the aggregation and reporting of results were tested prior to the election, they were not tested in the exact scenario that Johnson County experienced,” the company said in a statement. “Most specifically, the number of ballot positions exceeded the number in the test scenario.”</p><p>One computer science professor said Monday that this failure showed the testing was inadequate.<br/><br/></p><p>“The big issue apparently is that they didn’t test this system at scale,” said Duncan Buell, professor of computer science and engineering at the University of South Carolina, who has studied that state’s election results extensively. “You need to test for all possible scenarios.”</p><p>He said there should have been a way to simulate counting a high number of votes prior to Johnson County’s primary election, in which more than 120,000 votes were cast. </p><p>“If you really want to test this system at scale you’ve got to do something like that. It should be feasible,” Buell said.</p><p>Buell had seen a copy of <a href=\"https://jocogov.org/press-release/johnson-county-election-office-and-ess-announce-resolution-slow-reporting-election\" target=\"_blank\">Monday’s press release</a> about the Johnson County vote result problems and said he would be sharing it with his computer science students so they can see how things go wrong in the real world.</p><p>“We require students to write programs like adults and test them and document and make sure things work,” Buell said. “This demonstrates they can ignore us for four years and still get jobs.” </p><p>But Metsker staunchly defended the company. </p><p>“I believe they’re still the best vendor out there, and they’ve got the finest product we could have selected for Johnson County voters,” he said at headquarters in Olathe on Monday. </p><p>“While we were disappointed with what happened on election night in the primary, I am confident they have discovered what they need to do to make the corrections in software so we will not have this problem again.”</p><p>Both Metsker and ES&amp;S officials said the software problem occurred with the “back end” reporting code for results, and not with the vote tabulation software. That reporting code was also separate and distinct from about 1,000 new ExpressVote machines that Johnson County rolled out for the first time in the Aug. 7 primary.</p><p>“We did not experience any issues with the integrity of the new voting machines nor the accuracy of the vote tabulation in August,” Metsker said.</p><p>ES&amp;S officials said the reporting code caused extremely slow results because it was unnecessarily and constantly refreshing statistical data rather than actually processing the data. The new code has fixed that problem and it’s now being extensively tested to make sure it works, said Gary Weber, ES&amp;S vice president of software development, who was in Johnson County on Monday.</p><p>“We’re making changes to the code to make it perform the duties in a faster manner...very much faster,” he said.</p><p>Metsker also said the county will deploy all 2,100 machines in November to alleviate long lines. He said the election office will also recruit 1,000 more election workers to assist voters, about as many as would normally be needed in a presidential election.</p><p>Still, one critic who watches election equipment nationally questioned why Johnson County would have so much confidence that everything will be fine in November.<br/><br/></p><p>Susan Greenhalgh, policy director with the National Election Defense Coalition, suggested Johnson County would be better off with paper ballot machines, rather than with its new touchscreen machines that have a voter verified paper ballot backup for tabulation. Both Greenhalgh and Buell said paper ballot systems are two to three times less expensive than electronic machines and are more efficient and secure.<br/><br/></p><p>“The problems that Johnson County experienced, both the long lines and the slow results uploads, could both be easily solved by using voter-marked paper ballots and scanners.<br/><br/></p><p>“ES&amp;S individual scanners are used across the country without the upload issue of the ExpressVote scanners,” Greenhalgh said. “That Johnson County would not entertain the thought of returning the ExpressVotes and just getting tried-and-true scanners before the midterms is baffling. We know there will be high scrutiny of these elections, and their system is faulty. This makes no sense.”</p><p>Both Metsker and Weber argued that touchscreen machines with a paper backup are preferable. Weber said touchscreen machines make sure a voter doesn’t inadvertently skip a race or vote for more than one candidate in a particular race.</p><p>“This is really the best of both worlds,” Weber said.</p><p>Weber said he is confident the new code can be certified by federal and state officials, possibly by the end of September, well before the Nov. 6 general election.<br/><br/></p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">It’s been a little more than three years since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage, and the <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article218257110.html#cardLink=row1_card1\" target=\"_self\">debate over LGBTQ rights in Missouri</a> is ongoing. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Star’s readers wanted to know: Should Missouri state law protect LGBTQ people from discrimination at work, in housing decisions and at private businesses?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Plus, we asked: What do you think the biggest barrier is in Missouri to extending such protections?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Here’s how members of the Star’s Missouri Influencer panel answered those questions. Most favored protections for LGBTQ people.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Kay Barnes, former mayor of Kansas City, senior director for university engagement at Park University:</b> <span>“Yes.”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The barrier: </span>Lack of understanding and thus discrimination against members of the LGBT community.</p><p><b>Michael Barrett, Missouri State Public Defender director:</b> “Rationale for denying someone a basic need, whether it be a home, a job, or health care should be based on criteria that can be applied across the board and does not target classes of persons. Quite simply, it should not be legal to deprive someone of such a need based on the way they look, worship, or love.”</p><p>The barrier: “fear of excessive lawsuits.” </p><p><b>Brenda Bethman, director of UMKC Women’s Center:</b> “Yes, there needs to be state-level (ideally federal) protections in place — otherwise LGBTQ people will continue to face legal discrimination.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: Anti-LGBTQ prejudice is the biggest barrier.</p><p><b>Mark Bryant, attorney and former Kansas City Council member:</b> “It is unfortunate but Missouri law needs to protect LGBTQ people at work, in housing decisions and at private businesses. Otherwise, LGBTQ people will be subject to the same types of discrimination that persons of African-American, Mexican and foreign national descent suffer. The United States is great because it absorbs different people from different places and blends culture(s) into something new. LGBTQ people are talented and innovative. We should prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.”</p><p>The barrier: “Survey polls do not indicate broad support in Missouri for laws which prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.”</p><p><b>Mike Burke, attorney and former Kansas City Council member:</b> “The short answer is yes. Missouri needs to enter the 21st Century in its laws on discrimination. A nondiscrimination law on a statewide level would send a message nationally that we are a tolerant society. Our cities have already taken a lead on nondiscrimination but without state legislation we are behind the times.”</p><p>The barrier: “We have too many legislators who feel they need to play to the lowest denominator in their base rather than the population as a whole.”</p><p><b>Thomas Curran, president of Rockhurst University:</b> “The promotion of human dignity and the pursuit of the common good compels us to have laws in the state of Missouri that protect all people from discrimination at work, in matters of housing and in private business. When this is not the practice, we need to create laws that specifically protect any and all groups who have experienced discrimination in these matters.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Tragically, we come across circumstances and situations where the promotion and preservation of human dignity has not been practiced because it’s not believed that we are all created equal.”</p><p><b>Jack Danforth, former U.S. senator:</b> “<span>I think that people should be protected from discrimination based on sexual orientation, except I think that the law should allow for businesses and organizations to practice their religious beliefs when their religion does not recognize same-sex marriage.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Until very recently, most people had never heard of same-sex marriage, and could not imagine that it could exist. This has changed dramatically over a very few years as more and more people, especially young people, take same sex marriage for granted. As the years pass, there will be increasingly less opposition to it.”</span></p><p><b>Reza Derakhshani, UMKC associate professor of computer science and electrical engineering:</b> “Yes.” </p><p>The barrier: “Bitter and and emotionally charged partisan rivalries, catering to unfounded fears rather than evidence-based research.”</p><p><b>Jane Dueker, lawyer, radio host and former political adviser:</b> “Absolutely.”</p><p><span>The barrier: “I think there are religious objections from lawmakers. Some business groups object citing the creation of new lawsuits. Similar to gay marriage, I think the legislature will punt and force the courts to do the right thing and then say ‘it is settled.’”</span></p><p><b>Gwen Grant, Urban League of Greater Kansas City: </b>“Yes. These people should be added as a protected class in Missouri law, which should include language specific to sexual orientation and gender identity.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span>The barrier: “We’re a conservative state and the legislature reflects it.”</span></p><p><b>Jason Grill, media, public affairs and crisis communications consultant:</b> “<span>No individual should face discrimination at work or in their job in any case no matter race, creed, religion or sexual orientation.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Current political makeup and numbers in the Missouri General Assembly, as well as some viewpoints that private businesses can do what they choose and should not be regulated in this manner by the government.”</span></p><p><b>John Hancock, former chairman of Missouri Republican Party: </b>“<span>Nobody should be for discrimination.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Two potential hurdles: One is the need to respect religious conscience. The second is a reluctance to increase the amount of litigation.”</span></p><p><b>Deb Hermann, CEO of Northland Neighborhoods, Inc.: </b>“Yes.”</p><p>The barrier: “The House passed HB2100 last session — a good step. However, I am unsure of the governor’s action on this legislation. It needs to be approved. Ignorance inflamed by political rhetoric causes great damage to this cause.”</p><p><b>Bob Holden, former governor:</b> “Yes. If we want to achieve our best economic and social status we must become more inclusive.”</p><p>The barrier: “Lack of understanding and in some cases awareness.”</p><p><b>Sly James, mayor of Kansas City:</b> “Missouri law should protect all people from discrimination and in the decisions and circumstances that affect their lives. Neither the Bill of Rights, nor the Constitution of either the United States or the State of Missouri include the phrase ‘unless you are gay’ in the texts. Our history should be enough to remind us that discrimination comes to no good end.”</p><p>The barrier: “Political ideologies that pander to a group of citizens who, for religious or other reasons, do not see the LGBTQ community as complete and equal humans. The ideologies tend to view this segment of the electorate as a voting block to be pursued and won.”</p><p><b>Jolie Justus, Kansas City councilwoman:</b> “Yes.” </p><p>The barrier: “Leadership in the Missouri House and Senate and the Missouri Chamber of Commerce”</p><p><b>Gregg Keller, principal of Atlas Strategy Group:</b> “This is a worthwhile discussion to have as soon as, but not before, the political left settles upon a definition of gender identity that goes beyond how a given individual feels they ‘identify’ on any given day.”</p><p>The barrier: “The political left coming up with a coherent definition of the terms involved.”</p><p><b>Crosby Kemper III, director of the Kansas City Public Library, co-founder of the Show-Me Institute:</b> “As an employer in more than one field in my career, I have always been interested in hiring the best people regardless of what goes on in their private lives (if legal and not disturbing to the institutions’ customers or colleagues). I would resist adding special classes of protection beyond all the already powerful anti-discrimination laws. That said I’m open to evidence that such discrimination is a serious problem which needs legal redress.”</p><p><span>The barrier: “See above.”</span></p><p><b>Jennifer Lowry, chief toxicologist at Children’s Mercy Hospital:</b> “Absolutely! It is unfathomable to me that in 2018 we continue to have this conversation. All people deserve to work. All people deserve to have a home. All people deserve to walk into a business and be treated the same as any other person. Sex and gender of an individual is not a public discussion. It is personal to that individual and should not be judged by others. Those businesses who have employment opportunities should hire a person based on their ability to perform the job. Those who have housing to rent or sell should be proud that any person wants to live in that home. Those who have businesses that want to make a living should be happy to sell their product to those who want to enter their establishment. If we agree that sex and gender are protected, then so should the community that wears it proudly.”<br/><br/></p><p><span>The barrier: “The largest barrier to extending protections to the LGBTQ community are those who use religion to justify actions against those that make them uncomfortable. However, our constitution requires the separation of church and state and, thus, religion cannot be used as a basis for establishing law. Most importantly, however, most religious teachings, if the constitution allowed it to be considered, would promote kindness and love over hate and fear.”</span></p><p><b>Quinton Lucas, Kansas City Council member:</b> “<span>It’s unconscionable that Missouri law does not already protect LGBTQ persons from discrimination at work, in housing, and in private business. We should join the rest of the country and give our citizens all rights.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Bigotry remains our biggest barrier to extending rights to all persons.”</span></p><p><b>Dianne Lynch, president of Stephens College:</b> “Missouri needs the most talented, innovative and committed workforce it can attract and retain if it’s going to be competitive. That means it needs to be as inclusive and respectful of individual and privacy rights as the markets with which it is competing for talent. This isn’t a personal values question; it’s a business decision. So the answer in the best interests of all Missourians is: Yes. Absolutely. Without a doubt.”</p><p>The barrier: “There’s a blurring of the lines between personal values and beliefs, and economic analyses about what is likely to best serve all Missourians. Our leaders can respect the personal beliefs of all constituents and still support legislation that expands the state’s talent pool, markets and partnerships with those who don’t share those beliefs.”</p><p><b>Christopher Maples, interim chancellor of the Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology:</b> “Missouri state law should protect LGBTQ people from discrimination at work, in housing decisions, and at private businesses.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “The biggest barrier to Missouri extending protections to LGBTQ people may be the reticence of elected officials to introduce legislation that may be viewed as being in opposition to religious views held by some of their constituents.”</p><p><b>Richard Martin, director of governmental affairs at JE Dunn Construction:</b> “If there is not current law that protects the LGBTQ community from discrimination in housing, employment and their freedom to pursue economic opportunities without obstacles based on their sexual identity. Then yes.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Perhaps it’s in the state’s DNA to be more like a follower than a leader on progressive social issues.”</p><p><b>Jay Nixon, former governor:</b> “<span>Absolutely. Our state must lead on vital civil rights issues, and be a welcoming place to work and live.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “The major business interests and groups must prioritize this as ‘workforce’ development.”</span></p><p><b>Ken Novak, UMKC professor of criminal justice and criminology:</b> “State law should protect the LGBTQ community from discriminatory practices at work and other forums. LGBTQ is a protected class and citizens should expect the same legal protection from discriminatory behavior as gender, race, ethnicity, age, veteran status, etc. But beyond the legal implications — it’s just the right thing to do. That should be sufficient justification alone.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Like many protected classes the LGBTQ community comprises a small portion of the population — clearly the minority. Legislators, as well as citizens, likely have less familiarity with people in this community or the unique barriers they face, and, as such, (don’t prioritize) safeguards to mitigate discriminatory practices. Protection may be triaged as a lower priority (if it is a priority at all).”</p><p><b>CiCi Rojas, partner and president of Tico Productions and Tico Sports:</b> “In general, yes.” </p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Businesses or organizations who may have religious or bias that prohibit them.”</p><p><b>Leland Shurin, attorney, vice president Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners:</b> “Absolutely. I am amazed, disappointed and angered that it would still be a question/issue in Missouri at this time.”</p><p>The barrier: “The use by so many politicians of unreasonable fear as a political wedge issue and the erroneous interpretation of religious principles.”</p><p><b>Ryan Silvey, Missouri Public Service commissioner, former state senator: </b>“<span>Yes”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “There is a philosophical concern by several in the legislature with creating additional protected classes for any reason.”</span></p><p><b>Jeff Simon, managing partner, Husch Blackwell:</b> “Yes.” </p><p><span>The barrier: “A philosophical concern about over-regulation by government, combined with a lingering prejudice against gays among some.”</span></p><p><b>Phil Snowden, member of University of Missouri Board of Curators: </b>“<span>Yes. Yes. We’re all people and all in this together. We should have equal rights.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Sometimes movements take shape and the right course of action doesn’t evolve for years. This may not be the hottest issue to push in Missouri but the state is headed in the right direction.”</span></p><p><b>David Steelman, attorney, former state legislator, chairman of the University of Missouri Board of Curators:</b> “Yes.” </p><p>The barrier: “All reasonable people should agree that discrimination is wrong and should be discouraged. However, the details of the remedy are always more important than is realized. It is important the legislation not be unduly restrictive of religious freedom or freedom of association.”</p><p><b>Maurice Watson, partner at Husch Blackwell law firm: </b>“<span>Protections in Missouri are needed and overdue.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “There’s hope in the tolerant attitudes of younger people who are now of voting age.”</span></p><p><b>Pam Whiting, vice president for communications, Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce:</b> “<span>Absolutely.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: While attitudes and understanding continue to evolve, we still have a long way to go. SJR 39 came close to passage two years ago, but was narrowly defeated, which gives me hope, though similar bills have been introduced in the legislature the past two years. Thankfully, they didn’t go anywhere.</span></p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>For at least two decades, lawmakers in the <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article199081469.html\" target=\"_blank\">Missouri General Assembly have passed the baton</a> on gay rights.</p><p>But in 2019, those supporting legal protections for the LGBTQ community hope to cross something of a finish line.</p><p>Next year is when some expect to see passage of proposals floated every session since 1998 to include sexual orientation among societal classes protected from discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations. The effort has gone by the moniker MONA — the Missouri Nondiscrimination Act.</p><p>A consensus is building, no doubt: On the general point of gay, lesbian or transgender persons needing legal cover from losing jobs or potential homes on the sole basis of their sexual selves, The Kansas City Star’s panel of business leaders, policymakers, community catalysts and opinion shapers —<a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/influencers/\" target=\"_blank\"> “The Missouri Influencers” —</a> speak almost in a singular voice:</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>“Absolutely!” on the necessity for LGBTQ protections, said Jennifer Lowry, chief toxicologist at Children’s Mercy Hospital. “It is unfathomable to me that in 2018 we continue to have this conversation.”</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>“Absolutely,” echoed Pam Whiting, vice president for communications for the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>“An emphatic ‘YES’” to MONA, wrote former Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes, now at Park University, in response to a brief survey to Influencers on the issue.</p><p>But ask about the details: How exactly do we get there — ensuring that civil rights are equal between those LGBTQ and those not, in all matters public or private? Then some opinions waiver.</p><p>The Missouri Influencer Series brings together readers of The Star and 51 high-profile Missourians for conversations about the most pressing matters confronting the state. Asked about LGBTQ issues, readers in an online survey rated as their top question whether the state should extend legal protections to LGBTQ people at work, in housing decisions and in private businesses.</p><p>Of more than <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article218408650.html#storylink=mainstage\" target=\"_blank\">30 Influencers who weighed in on that question</a>, many allowed that difficult but realistic challenges stir in the details. </p><p>Who prevails, for example, when someone’s sexual orientation clashes with the biblical beliefs of a faith-based employer or adoption agency, wedding planner, university or service providers to the aged?</p><p>Or, how should society settle tensions that arise when schools provide special restroom privileges for pupils transitioning to the gender with which they identify?</p><p>That riddle is now being weighed by the Missouri Supreme Court, which could rule by Election Day on <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article209799884.html\" target=\"_blank\">a locker room dispute in the Blue Springs School District.</a></p><p>The primary beachheads in Missouri and much of the nation are courtrooms considering, case by case, matters pitting religious liberties, personal privacy and the meaning of equal protection. </p><p>In a yet another case being mulled by the Missouri Supreme Court, a gay man working for the state Department of Social Services said he was treated poorly because he lacked “stereotypical attributes of how a male should appear and behave.” Missouri’s Human Rights Commission rejected his case after ruling that the worker was claiming discrimination on sexual orientation rather than on his sex, or gender, and thus he was not in a protected class under state law. </p><p>An appeals court ruled in the man’s favor and the state appealed.</p><p>“There are still many people not there with us,” said Kansas City Councilwoman Jolie Justus.</p><p>She was the first openly gay person to win a state Senate seat 12 years ago. </p><p>Despite enormous strides in LGBTQ acceptance since then, Justus said, Missourians in many communities can still be fired for setting on their office desk a portrait of a same-sex spouse.</p><h3>Equal protection</h3><p>Sharpest on the radar of gay-rights issues in Missouri is potential passage of a bill that would protect what groups increasingly call “LGBTQ” persons from discrimination in employment and housing.</p><p>(Just this summer the St. Louis-based advocacy group<a href=\"https://promoonline.org/news/we-are-adding-the-q/\" target=\"_blank\"> PROMO added to the LGBT designation the letter “Q”</a> , for queer, signifying a proud stance of many in the movement, especially millennials, to project more inclusive lifestyles over specific categories of sexuality.)</p><p>Regarding job discrimination, push-back groups include the Associated Industries of Missouri, representing hundreds of companies. Ray McCarty, the group’s president and CEO, told The Star, “We oppose legislation that sets up new ways of suing employers.”</p><p>The concern over creating grounds for too many lawsuits is expressed by some Kansas City area Influencers, as well. </p><p>“I would resist adding special classes of protection beyond the already powerful anti-discrimination laws,” said Crosby Kemper III, director of the Kansas City Public Library. “That said, I’m open to evidence that such discrimination is a serious problem which needs legal redress.”</p><p>Missouri House Rep. Greg Razer, a Kansas City Democrat, is trying. He said he and a Republican colleague — the only openly gay members of the legislature — are encountering growing support from legislators to approve LGBTQ protections after 20 years of dodging the Missouri Nondiscrimination Act.</p><p>In May, Razer’s bill <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article211342324.html\" target=\"_blank\">won 6-0 approval from a state legislative committee</a> — just the second time a committee cleared a MONA measure since the movement took off. “That’s as far as we got,” Razer said. “And sadly, that was a victory.”</p><p>But he expressed confidence that anti-discrimination forces finally have enough backing from Missouri lawmakers — including many older Republicans once opposed — that a resubmitted bill may quickly become law after legislators convene in January.</p><p>“I feel like at any moment the floodgate on this issue is going to open,” Razer said. </p><p>He noted that <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article212688674.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, voted as a state senator</a> in 2013 for one version of the Missouri Nondiscrimination Act. </p><p>No such measure became law this year, as legislative leaders who have come around on MONA were cautious not to rile conservative voter bases in 2018 elections. But Razer said that he has heard enough support from both sides of the political aisle that passage is closer than ever before.</p><p>John Hancock, a political consultant who for many years headed the Missouri GOP, agreed.</p><p>With conditions.</p><p>“If it’s written narrowly enough” so as not to impose on the rights on faith-based employers who might “object out of conscience,” then many conservatives will support the legislation, Hancock said.</p><p> “As a matter of general principle,” he added, “nobody should be for discrimination.”</p><p>Kansas City, Jackson and St. Louis counties and a dozen other Missouri cities have local ordinances that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. But for LGBTQ persons facing unfair treatment at work or in obtaining housing, “to use just a city law to get the protections they need isn’t enough,” Justus said. </p><p>She said it’s time for the state to extend protections it has long carved into law for classes of race, age, religion, sex and the disabled. </p><h3>Schools and gender ID</h3><p>On another front, Missouri public school districts are quickly confronting, one by one, a push in some communities for “gender-neutral” bathrooms.</p><p>When classes opened last month in the North Kansas City School District, students and parents seemed to welcome fully enclosed <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article216439305.html\" target=\"_self\">single-occupancy stalls</a> at two new grade schools, two sixth-grade centers and North Kansas City High School. Signage on the rooms feature male and female figures, providing private and more comfortable accommodations for students regardless of their gender identity, school officials told The Star.</p><p>In Blue Springs, a legal showdown ensued in 2016 when school administrators denied a transgender student’s request to use male locker room facilities. </p><p>Attorneys for the teen — identified as “RMA” in court documents — argue the pupil was discriminated against on sex-based grounds, a violation of the Missouri Human Rights Act. The school district counters that the law’s definition of “sex” doesn’t apply to RMA’s request. </p><p>A Jackson County judge and the Missouri Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the district. A state supreme court decision is expected in the fall.</p><p>Across Missouri, “we’ve had school districts quietly working with transgender students for a while, and nobody’s even noticed,” said Kelli Hopkins, associate executive director for the Missouri School Board Association. “Most district don’t draw a line until it comes to locker rooms and bathrooms.</p><p>“As cases are going up through the courts, you’re getting different results...We recommend that (schools) do whatever you can to accommodate all students.”</p><p>Transgender accommodations, in schools and the workplace, will continue to evolve, said attorney Maurice Watson, who heads a diversity and inclusion committee at the Husch Blackwell law firm.</p><p>Watson, an Influencer, said he has sat in meetings with local corporations attended by prominent transgender employees young and old.</p><p>“They may not be on the corporate board, but these are people in visible positions at their firms,” Watson said. “They are present and they are proud.” <br/><br/></p><h3>Religious freedoms</h3><p>Many of The Star’s Influencers referenced a need to respect religious freedoms while affirming LGBTQ rights and legal protections.</p><p>Former U.S. Sen. Jack Danforth: “I think that people should be protected from discrimination based on sexual orientation, except I think that the law should allow for businesses and organizations to practice their religious beliefs when their religion does not recognize same-sex marriage.”</p><p>Former state legislator David Steelman, chairman of the University of Missouri Board of Curators: “All reasonable people should agree that discrimination is wrong and should be discouraged. </p><p>“However, the details of the remedy are always more important than is realized. It is important the legislation not be unduly restrictive of religious freedom or freedom of association.”</p><p>Lawyer and radio host Jane Dueker questioned whether the statehouse ever will agree on a resolution: “Similar to gay marriage, I think the legislature will punt and force the courts to do the right thing then say, ‘it is settled.’”</p><p>Wouldn’t be a first for Jefferson City. </p><p>“Perhaps it’s in the state’s DNA,” said Influencer Richard Martin, of JE Dunn Construction, “to be more like a follower than a leader on progressive issues.”</p><p><span><br/><br/></span></p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\">The Star’s Allison Kite contributed this report.</div><p>Previous survey: <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article217982680.html\" target=\"_blank\">Organized labor</a></p><p>Next survey: Minimum wage</p><h3>We want to hear from you</h3><p>Initiative petitions have put minimum wage hikes on ballots across the country in recent years, and this year, Missourians will vote this fall on whether to raise the minimum rate to $12 per hour.

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Down in the polls, short on cash, and running out of time, Republican conservative firebrand Chris McDaniel says he’s far from cooked in his bid to win a U.S. Senate seat from Mississippi that he believes was stolen from him four years ago.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But polls say otherwise.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“When I first ran four years ago, what did the establishment say? ‘Not a chance, he may get 15 percent of the vote, his political career is over.’ Didn’t happen,” McDaniel said. “We were one of the first ‘Drain the Swamp’ candidates. We’re going to be fine.”</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>McDaniel’s 2018 campaign has seen a dramatic reversal of fortune from the 2014 Senate run that made him a tea party darling, garnered national attention, branded him as a conservative star on the rise, and shook the Republican Party establishment to its core.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“For some reason, though, the fire hasn’t started burning very brightly for Chris’ campaign this time,” said Marty Wiseman, former director of the John C. Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University. “It’s kind of left him sitting dead in the water.”</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Polls indicate that McDaniel is running a distant third in the Nov. 6 special election to replace Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Mississippi, who retired in April citing health reasons.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>If he, Republican </span><a href=\"https://cindyhydesmith.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith</a><span> or Democrat </span><a href=\"https://espyforsenate.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Espy</a><span>, a former U.S. House member and Clinton administration agriculture secretary, fail to win more than 50 percent of the vote in the so-called “jungle” election, the top two finishers will face each other in a Nov. 27 runoff.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>McDaniel says part of his campaign’s struggles are rooted in Republican Party success</span><span>. Barack Obama is out of the White House and Donald Trump is in. The GOP controls the Senate and the House of Representatives, regulations are being rolled back, and conservative judges are being nominated and confirmed.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“You still have the (voter) anger, but there is also a degree of satisfaction among some percentage of the base,” McDaniel said in an interview in his Laurel, Miss., law office. “They feel like things are in order, the structure is good against, that things are improving.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://mcdaniel2018.com/\" target=\"_blank\">McDaniel</a><span> was the top vote-getter in a 2014 primary but narrowly lost in a bitter runoff by to longtime incumbent Cochran. The senator’s return to Washington was boosted by overtures to Democratic-leaning African-American voters — a political theft in McDaniel’s mind.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>He refused to concede and defiantly filed a lawsuit alleging rampant voter fraud. He complained that Cochran wooed Democrats who didn’t intend to vote for him in the general election.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>A Mississippi state judge dismissed the lawsuit.</span><b> </b>But the GOP establishment, already wary of McDaniel, grew even more distant.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“Chris McDaniel left a pretty bitter taste in Republicans’ mouths at the conclusion by filing the court challenge dragging the GOP through the mud,” former state Sen. Merle Flowers told the Associated Press in February.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Still, McDaniel believes there’s enough lingering voter resentment over the 2014 runoff and anger toward GOP elites – read Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. - to take him to victory.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“A lot of individuals still feel like that race was stolen from them in 2014,” he said. “There’s a lot of conversation about that and how it wasn’t fair and how that was the system working against the people just as the system has always worked against the people.”</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>McDaniel was hoping for a much-needed endorsement from Trump — who tweeted in 2014 that McDaniel “is strong, he is smart &amp; he wants to change things in Washington” — to boost his campaign.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>But instead of supporting a political kindred spirit in McDaniel, Trump opted to back Hyde-Smith, a former Democrat who was appointed by Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant to temporarily fill Cochran’s seat.</span></p><p> <!-- %asset:218265240% --> </p><p> <!-- %asset:218264925% --> </p><p><span>The people of Mississippi understand that President Trump occasionally has to cut deals by Mitch McConnell,” McDaniel said of the endorsement. “How else can you explain that he endorsed Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and John McCain? These are individuals who are hostile toward a President Trump, yet President Trump endorsed them.”</span></p><p>Still, McDaniel is reeling. The millions in campaign contributions that poured into McDaniel coffers from tea party and conservative political action committees in 2014 have slowed to a trickle, if they come at all.</p><p><span>And the celebrity-filled Tea Party Express campaign </span><a href=\"http://www.teapartyexpress.org/8152/tea-party-express-bus-is-rolling-to-mississippi\" target=\"_blank\">tour bus</a><span> that roared through Mississippi on McDaniel’s behalf in 2014 won’t be there in 2018, according to Sal Russo, a co-founder and strategist for the group.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Tea Party Express has always been a believer of (conservative commentator and author) Bill Buckley’s rule to support the most electable conservative,” Russo said. “We’re not afraid of taking a chance, but we have to see a path to victory.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">McDaniel says that path is being blocked by a Mississippi and national Republican establishment that’s trying to suffocate his campaign. He’s not wrong.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Hyde-Smith, who is vying to become the first woman elected to Congress from Mississippi, is being aided by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a McConnell ally.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She’s also getting help from the<span> Mississippi Victory Fund, an </span><a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00671669&amp;cycle=2018\" target=\"_blank\">anti-McDaniel </a><span>political action committee that was established earlier this year.

              "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>A move by prosecutors deciding who was responsible for July’s sinking of a Branson duck boat may mean it will be years before victims and their families get their days in court.</p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Soon after a <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/missouri/article215212175.html\" target=\"_self\">duck boat sank on Table Rock Lake</a>, relatives of some of the 17 who died, survivors and even a rescuer filed suit.</p><p>But a move by federal prosecutors investigating the July 19 tragedy could put those cases on hold indefinitely. For victims and their families, it might be years before they get their day in court.</p><p>“The families want justice and closure,” attorneys for some of the victims said in a federal court filing last week. “These families brought this action to get answers to what happened and to ensure it does not happen to someone else’s family in the future.</p><p>“The efforts of the United States Attorney to delay closure for the victims will only prolong their suffering.”</p><p>And it could mean that the public may have to wait indefinitely to learn exactly what happened that July night when a Ride the Ducks boat sank in stormy weather on the southwest Missouri lake.</p><p>Federal prosecutors have asked courts to halt all discovery and release of information until their criminal investigation is complete. If approved, the action would stall depositions, examination of evidence and requests for records.</p><p>“This just delays everything and keeps these wounds open — it doesn’t allow these families to move on,” said Gerald McGonagle, a Kansas City attorney representing the daughters of a Higginsville couple who died in the tragedy. “There’s no reason to stop us from getting documents, there’s no reason to stop us from deposing witnesses and moving forward with the process.”</p><p>At this point, no one is charged in relation to the tragedy and there’s no way to know when the investigation will be completed. Some federal cases take years before they make it to trial.</p><p>Prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri have argued that the action is necessary to prevent civil lawsuits from interfering with the federal probe. The release of information, they say, could create a “severe prejudice” in their investigation.</p><p>When contacted recently about the motion, Don Ledford, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office, said he could not comment.</p><p>Adam Graves, another Kansas City attorney working on the Higginsville family’s lawsuit — which was filed in Taney County — said when someone from the U.S. Attorney’s office first contacted him about the motion, he was told that it would be “a very limited stay of about six months.”</p><p>“He said, ‘We don’t want to get in the way; we understand these families need their day in court,’” Graves said. “But now they’ve asked for a stay that will include all the way through criminal trial and beyond. So we could be talking five, eight years.”</p><p>Robert Mongeluzzi, a Philadelphia attorney representing several plaintiffs who have sued Ripley Entertainment — current owner of the Branson operation — and Ride the Ducks International in federal court, filed an objection to the stay last week and sought some middle ground.</p><p>That objection proposed ways the civil cases could advance without hindering the government’s probe or jeopardizing the rights of those under investigation. It suggested plaintiffs’ attorneys could wait nine months before testing physical evidence or questioning criminal targets as well as others essential to the investigation.</p><p>That waiting period would allow plaintiffs’ attorneys to carry out additional matters, such as questioning witnesses who saw the duck boat sink and passengers on a nearby boat that didn’t sink.</p><p>In mid-August, the U.S. Coast Guard <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/missouri/article217073595.html\" target=\"_self\">referred the criminal investigation</a> to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri to pursue possible federal charges. That office, based in Kansas City, includes the Table Rock Lake area.</p><p>The Coast Guard notified prosecutors that its preliminary determination was that the sinking of Stretch Duck 07 and the loss of lives “resulted from the misconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties of the captain of the vessel at the time of the sinking, which is a violation of federal criminal law.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:215301795% --> </p><p>The first 911 call about the boat came at 7:09 p.m., 14 minutes after the boat entered the water that July night. The popular Branson tourist attraction takes passengers on a tour of land and water.</p><p>The National Weather Service had <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/missouri/article215222260.html\" target=\"_blank\">issued a severe thunderstorm warning</a> at 6:32 p.m., specifically naming Table Rock Lake. The warning said winds in excess of 60 mph were possible. In reality, winds on the lake reached nearly hurricane level at 73 mph, with waves of more than 3 feet.</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/missouri/article215671830.html\" target=\"_self\">recent report by the National Transportation Safety Board</a>, the captain and driver were on board at 6:28 that evening when someone stepped onto the back of the boat and told the crew to take the water portion of the tour first. It isn’t known who that person is. The driver, whose job is to steer the duck boat on land, died in the sinking.</p><p>Stretch Duck 07 entered the water at 6:55 p.m.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/missouri/article215233100.html\" target=\"_self\">Cellphone video taken from the nearby Showboat Branson Belle</a>, which was docked at the time of the storm, captured the two boats as they struggled in the water. A viral video of the incident ended right before the boat went under. The boat’s captain, Kenneth Scott McKee, was among the 14 survivors.</p><p>According to a recent court filing, McKee and the other boat captain — Barry King — are <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article217514420.html\" target=\"_self\">targets of the ongoing criminal investigation</a>. They are under investigation for allegedly operating the vessel in a manner that endangered lives.</p><p><a href=\"https://cue.misitemgr.com/The%20Branson%20boat%E2%80%99s%20certificate%20%E2%80%94%20which%20The%20Star%20requested%20immediately%20after%20the%20July%2019%20tragedy%20%E2%80%94%20set%20stringent%20guidelines%20for%20wind%20and%20water%20conditions.%20%E2%80%9CVessel%20shall%20not%20be%20operated%20waterborne%20when%20winds%20exceed%2035%20mph,%20and/or%20the%20wave%20height%20exceeds%20two%20feet,%E2%80%9D%20said%20the%20certificate%20issued%20in%20February%202017.\" target=\"_self\">The certificate of inspection for Stretch Duck 07</a> set stringent guidelines for wind and water conditions. It states that the “vessel shall not be operated waterborne when winds exceed 35 mph, and/or the wave height exceeds two feet.”</p><p>One major concern with the motion, Graves said, is that a long delay could prevent the victims’ attorneys from gaining access to the duck boat to try to determine if it had mechanical or design problems. And the longer the boat sits, he said, the more difficult that will be.</p><p>“We might never know if a part was defective or if it just went bad from sitting so long,” he said. “There’s a whole host of problems.”</p><p>Another issue is that plaintiffs would have trouble determining whether they have included all the proper parties in their lawsuits.</p><p>It’s not just the victims’ families who would suffer from a delay. The public could also be left in the dark about the safety of the duck boats.</p><p>“These things are still operating all across the U.S., in Hawaii and the Caribbean,” Graves said. “I think it’s important for the public to be aware that these things are deadly, and here’s why they’re deadly.”</p><p>The Star requested information from the Coast Guard related to the captain’s license. That request was denied because it “relates to a pending law enforcement investigation.”</p><p>“Therefore, I am withholding all records, documents, and/or other material, which if disclosed prior to completion, could reasonably be expected to interfere with law enforcement proceedings and final agency actions related to those proceedings,” wrote Captain K.R. Martin, in a letter to The Star.</p><p>A hearing on the motion to stay discovery in the federal lawsuits has been scheduled for Nov. 1 in Springfield. A hearing on the lawsuits in state court will be heard at a separate, undetermined time.</p><p>On the federal motion, attorneys for the victims and their families will argue there’s an emotional component involved when information is withheld for long periods of time. Especially when other duck boats across the country are still on the water.</p><p>“Completely shutting down all civil cases for an unlimited amount of time, as the government requests, is not the answer,” the objection said. “It would be inefficient, unwarranted and highly prejudicial to plaintiffs and to the victims of this tragedy. Justice delayed is justice denied.”</p></div>",

Two would amend the Missouri Constitution and a third would legalize cannabis by state statute.</p><p>One constitutional amendment, promoted by an organization called A New Approach Missouri, would allow doctors to prescribe cannabis for 10 specific medical issues, including epilepsy, cancer, chronic pain and PTSD. The measure would tax medical marijuana sales and direct the revenue toward health for veterans through the Missouri Veterans Commission.</p><p>The second constitutional amendment is promoted by Springfield, Mo., lawyer and physician Brad Bradshaw. It would create a state research institute that could determine what medical conditions can be treated with marijuana. It also would direct some tax revenue for veterans’ health care.</p><p>The third ballot measure is called the Missourians for Patient Care Act. Its proponents say it would be easier to set up a regulatory framework for medical marijuana under a statute that can be amended than it would a constitutional amendment that could only be changed by another vote of the people. </p><p>Grissom, who was appointed U.S. attorney by former President Barack Obama and served from 2010 to 2016, said public support for marijuana legalization has risen from 12 percent in 1969 to 61 percent now. If he was running for elective office, Grissom said, “I’m going to ride that horse.”<br/><br/></p><p>The former prosecutor also noted that cannabis legalization is not a partisan issue, pointing out that Hillary Clinton lost the electoral vote in North Dakota, Arkansas and Florida — three states that approved medical marijuana. </p><p>Grissom said that even before he stepped down as U.S. attorney he paid a surprise visit to the Washington office of <a href=\"http://norml.org/\" target=\"_self\">NORML</a>, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, and said “I’m here to help.” <br/><br/></p><p>Now in private practice, Grissom told his audience at the Crowne Plaza hotel that he does not use cannabis. But he said he believes it is bad public policy to use resources to prosecute and incarcerate people who do.<br/><br/></p><p>Grissom said legalizing marijuana creates jobs and money that does not go to cartels or other bad actors. But he said existing banking laws and regulations remain a challenge to those who would become entrepreneurs in a legal marijuana environment.</p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill and Attorney General Josh Hawley pulled no punches in their first face-to-face showdown of the 2018 campaign Friday, with each hammering the other on issues ranging from health care to judicial nominations to tax returns.</p><p>At a Friday candidate forum sponsored by the Missouri Press Association, Hawley, a Republican, sought to paint McCaskill as a “Washington liberal” who was out of step with Missouri voters. He vowed to work to enact President Donald Trump’s agenda if he unseats McCaskill in November.</p><p>“I have heard what the people of this state said in 2016,” said Hawley, noting Trump’s 19-percentage-point victory in Missouri two years ago.</p><p>McCaskill, a Democrat, said her record shows she’s a moderate who is willing to work across the aisle to get things done for Missouri. She said Hawley, by contrast, has demonstrated an unwillingness to stand up to the president or his own party.</p><p>“If you want someone who always agrees with his party,” McCaskill said, “then Josh Hawley is your candidate.”</p><p>She cited Hawley’s support for Trump’s trade war as an example, saying Hawley is siding with the president instead of Missouri farmers who are being financially hurt by tariffs implemented by the president.</p><p>“You have to have independence,” McCaskill said of Hawley. “You have to stand up for your state.”</p><p>Hawley said he supports Trump’s approach of using tariffs to force better trade deals, as well as his plan to provide direct financial assistance to farmers impacted by the trade war with China.</p><p>“If we’re going to be in a war,” he said, “I want to win it.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article218331330.html\" target=\"_self\">Hawley, whose office joined 20 other attorneys general</a> around the country in a lawsuit seeking to repeal the Affordable Care Act, said McCaskill has been lying when she says he is trying to eliminate requirements that insurance companies cover those with pre-existing medical conditions.</p><p>Protections for pre-existing conditions don’t have to be tied to the federal health care law, he said, which has only served to drive up insurance premiums for Missourians.</p><p>“I will never support taking away health insurance coverage for those with pre-existing conditions,” he said.</p><p>The attorney general is engaging in a “Potomac two-step,” McCaskill said, arguing that if Hawley’s lawsuit is successful the mandate to cover pre-existing conditions will also be repealed.</p><p>Asked about the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, McCaskill said she has not yet made up her mind on whether to support him but expressed concern about some of his opinions on “dark money.”</p><p>She said she supported nearly all of former Republican President George W. Bush’s nominees and two-thirds of Trump’s.</p><p>“I don’t think that’s a record of an obstructionist,” she said.</p><p>Hawley said Kavanaugh is the kind of judge Missourians said they wanted to put on the bench when they voted for Trump. McCaskill, he said, supported every one of “President Obama’s liberal nominees” while opposing the nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch last year.</p><p>She only supports nominees to the Supreme Court, Hawley said, who want to “force the government to help illegal immigrant teen-agers get abortions, throw open our borders and take away our second amendment rights.”</p><p>One of Hawley’s main lines of attack Friday during the debate — and again afterward to reporters — was an accusation that McCaskill and her husband Joe Shepard, a developer, pocketed $131 million in federal subsidies.</p><p>Hawley and his wife released their 2017 tax returns this week. McCaskill released only her returns, as she and Shepard file separately. Hawley is demanding Shepard’s tax returns be released.</p><p>“Release your returns, and if you won’t, will you pledge to give back the $131 million in federal subsidies that you’ve taken and gotten rich off of?” Hawley said.</p><p>His characterization of that figure is inaccurate, as are GOP ads that make similar claims. The $131 million figure comes from <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article215234680.html\" target=\"_self\">a Kansas City Star investigation published in July</a>. As McCaskill pointed out during the debate, The Star reported that the money did not go directly to Shepard but to affordable housing projects he’s invested in.</p><p>Shepard only pocketed a fraction of that total, although his personal income from his investments in those businesses did grow exponentially during his wife’s two terms in the Senate.</p><p>In 2006, the year McCaskill was elected to the Senate, her husband’s personal income from his investments in federal housing projects was between $1,608 and $16,731, The Star found.</p><p>By 2017, Shepard was reporting personal earnings of between $365,374 and $1,118,158 from investments in such projects.</p><p>The Star’s article also noted that there’s no evidence McCaskill played any role in directing the federal funds to businesses her husband was invested in.</p><p>McCaskill said every year Republicans try to demonize her husband’s success by distorting the truth about his business.</p><p>“He’s a very successful businessman,” she said. “He’s done exactly what the Republican Party preaches. He started out with nothing and built a fabulously successful business, creating thousands of jobs and great wealth.”</p><p>Also on the stage were Green Party candidate Jo Crain and independent candidate Craig O’Dear. Libertarian candidate Japheth Campbell did not attend.</p><p>O’Dear said the ugly tone of the Senate campaign is exactly why he’s running as an independent.</p><p>“Both of these candidates are claiming independence and claiming the other one is not,” he said. “There is a reason. They know exactly what the problem is. They know exactly what the antidote is. That’s independence.”</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\">Lindsay Wise of The Star’s Washington bureau contributed to this report.</div></div>",

A proposed separation agreement to pay her $350,000 goes to the City Council for a vote Monday night.</p><p>Harrison-Lee could not be reached for comment.</p><p>She had been placed on administrative leave at the end of August <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article218215350.html\" target=\"_blank\">under mysterious circumstances</a>, with the mayor and city council members refusing to comment about what they termed a “personnel matter.”</p><p>On Friday, the city issued a press release saying Harrison-Lee had resigned effective Sept. 10. The announcement went on to praise her contributions to the city since she was hired in 2012, especially in the areas of strategic planning and economic development. </p><p>Gardner is one of Johnson County’s fastest growing cities, with a population of more than 21,000. It has recently attracted a new hotel and conference center, along with a multimillion-dollar manufacturing and distribution center for a California-based educational supply company. </p><p>“On behalf of the city, I want to thank Cheryl for her contribution in positioning Gardner for business expansion and economic growth,” Mayor Steve Shute said in a statement. “She helped set the framework, and we will continue to build upon her legacy to see our complete vision come to fruition.”<br/><br/></p><p>Shute declined further comment when reached by phone Friday evening.</p><p>On Monday night, the city council will consider approving a separation agreement and full release between the city of Gardner and Harrison-Lee.</p><p>It calls for paying her $261,569 in severance pay, $85,931 for unused vacation hours and $2,500 for a claim waiver under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The city would also agree to pay her COBRA health insurance payments for 18 months, either in a lump sum or monthly.</p><p>Harrison-Lee was named city administrator in July 2012, and the city council voted in 2016 to extend her employment contract for another four years. Her base salary at the time of the contract extension was $161,000, and she was entitled to annual increases based on meeting performance expectations.</p><p>But a new council term began this past January, with a new mayor and several new council members. Some observers said the new leaders wanted to make some changes. <br/><br/></p><p>The city will accept an award for performance management from the International City/County Management Association in Baltimore later this month, and supporters had credited Harrison-Lee with being instrumental in that award. The separation agreement notes that the city had previously paid for her airfare and registration for that conference. The city will not seek reimbursement for those costs and will pay her lodging expenses at that conference.</p><p>On Monday night, the city council will consider appointing Finance Director Laura Gourley as interim city administrator. It will also begin a process for a nationwide search to fill the administrator position.</p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Congressional Republican leaders are confident the government has enough disaster aid to help with Hurricane Florence relief. Some Democrats think more money will be needed.</p><p>That could trigger a political battle just weeks before the midterm elections.</p><p>Such a fight would force conservative Republicans, who routinely insist they’re devoted to fiscal discipline, to spend more money so they won’t look callous after a natural disaster.</p><p>That’s proven to be a tough choice for many Republicans in the past, and it likely would be again.<br/><br/></p><p>Steve Ellis, vice president of the advocacy group Taxpayers for Common Sense, is already<b> </b>warning that Congress is about to write another lavish check when voters want fiscal restraint.</p><p>“What’s going to happen is, you can’t separate politics from the reality, and here you’ve got an election coming up, see a lot of stories about people that are trying to get their lives back together, the damage in the area, and there’s going to be a lot of pressure to do something,” said Ellis, who would like lawmakers to exhaust current resources before authorizing more.</p><p>On Friday morning, as the massive storm was making its way through the Carolinas, a senior aide with the House Republican Appropriations Committee told McClatchy that the Disaster Relief Fund — the official account used by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to respond to the most immediate recovery needs — contained $25.6 billion.</p><p>“(This) is more than sufficient to meet current and ongoing needs,” the aide said.</p><p>“The FEMA fund is pretty well stocked right now, there’s no immediate need for money,” Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, a senior appropriator who wants to run the full committee in the next Congress, had agreed Thursday. </p><p>But at a separate press conference Friday on Capitol Hill, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California didn’t hesitate to declare this sum insufficient for likely long term rebuilding efforts. </p><p> <!-- %asset:218408330% --> </p><p>In response to a question from McClatchy about whether she anticipated Congress would have to pass a special emergency disaster relief bill to help storm-ravaged North Carolina and South Carolina, Pelosi replied, “I think we are going to need more money, yes.”</p><p>As of midday Friday, Hurricane Florence — a Category 1 storm — was battering both states with devastating flooding, damaging winds and hundreds of thousands of downed power lines. The storm is expected to move slowly and linger for several more days, so it’s unclear what other damage could be incurred. At least five people have died.</p><p>In a conference call Friday afternoon, Alex Amparo, deputy assistant administrator of FEMA’s National Preparedness Directorate, said it was “very premature” to predict how much money it would cost to address damage from the hurricane.</p><p>In Washington, D.C., the GOP’s staunchest fiscal conservatives have a history of fighting emergency spending bills that aren’t fully paid for with corresponding cuts to others programs. An ideological standoff prompted a delay in passing aid after Superstorm Sandy ravaged parts of New York and New Jersey in 2012.</p><p>There were grumbles last year as Republican leaders sought to advance disaster aid after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, though Cole pointed out there were fewer holdouts in 2017 than after Sandy hit..</p><p>“I’ve noticed a lot of born-again people in disaster relief since we’ve had the series of hurricanes,” said Cole, noting that fiscal conservatives tend to support such bills when “their area gets hit.”</p><p>Still, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was already making it clear he wasn’t interested in passing a disaster relief bill without offsets, even to rebuild his home state.</p><p>“I’ve always been consistent that we ought to fund FEMA and fund those items in preparation for storms that continue to come ... in a proactive way, not with emergency declarations every single time,” said Meadows, “because if we’re going to do that, then the budget is meaningless. </p><p>“It means what we are doing, each and every Congress, is passing an emergency appropriations bill, and that’s not the way to do business.”</p><p>Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the founding Freedom Caucus chairman who wants to be the Speaker of the House in the next Congress, said he didn’t want to discuss hypothetical scenarios, but “I think when you got a $20 trillion debt, you gotta look at offsets.”</p><p>Pelosi acknowledged that Congress would have to wait and see the extent of the trauma on the Carolinas, but warned Republicans would have no excuse not to vote to spend more money if needed.</p><p>“Last year, the Republicans in the Congress of the United States were so irresponsible, taking our country $2 trillion into debt to give tax cuts that befitted the top 1 percent,” Pelosi said. “If they could do that, and squander and increase the debt and then nickel and dime us on meeting the needs of individuals in our communities, that’s just not right. I don’t think they would go down that path.”</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\">Emma Dumain: <a href=\"tel:202-383-6126\">202-383-6126</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Emma_Dumain\" target=\"_blank\">@Emma_Dumain</a></div><p></p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>The two leading candidates for Missouri auditor clashed Friday in the first debate of the campaign season, with each lobbing accusations at the other’s qualifications to hold the office.</p><p>Democrat Nicole Galloway, who has held the office since 2015, said Republican Saundra McDowell has a history of lying about her personal finances, her resume and her residency. She said she would be hesitant to hire McDowell “as an entry level auditor given her issues.”</p><p>McDowell punched back at Galloway by pointing to a lawsuit by a conservative nonprofit accusing the Democrat of violating the state’s Sunshine Law. She said Galloway has fallen short of her job to take on public corruption, “and if you’re not a watchdog, then you’re just a dog. And I’ll be a bulldog.”</p><p>The debate, which was sponsored by the Missouri Press Association, also featured three other candidates for auditor: Constitution Party candidate Jacob Luetkemeyer, Libertarian Sean O’Toole and Green Party candidate Don Fitz.</p><p>But the frontrunners trained their fire squarely on each other.</p><p>McDowell has faced questions surrounding whether she meets the residency requirement in the constitution to run for auditor. The constitution says a person must live in Missouri 10 years to serve as auditor, but McDowell lived in Kansas in 2013. She refused to clarify Friday when asked by reporters why she never mentioned her time living in Kansas before it was discovered by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch last month.</p><p>She was also attacked by Galloway for her history of financial problems, including numerous lawsuits she has faced regarding unpaid debt.</p><p>Galloway said those poor finances could lead to corruption in the auditor’s office.</p><p>“What Missourians don’t need is an auditor so financially compromised that she may take dark money… to look the other way in audits,” Galloway said.</p><p>McDowell said she is the most qualified person running for auditor, pointing to her experience in the Air Force and more recently as an investigator in the attorney general’s office and in the securities division of the secretary of state’s office.</p><p>“I’m a soldier with a legal mind,” McDowell said. “I’m ready to fight for the people of Missouri.”</p><p>Accusations made by Galloway that she exaggerated her resume are completely false, McDowell said, and were not worth dignifying with a response during the debate.</p><p>Galloway and McDowell also disagreed over the proposed constitutional amendment called Clean Missouri.</p><p>Clean Missouri, which would appear as Amendment 1 on voters’ ballots, included a major redistricting proposal and proposed lowering campaign donation limits, eliminating nearly all lobbyist gifts, requiring legislators and Statehouse staffers to wait two years before taking jobs in lobbying and opening legislative records.</p><p>Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green on Friday ordered it off the November ballot after ruling the proposed amendment violated a provision in the Missouri Constitution that limits the scope of initiative petitions. Under the provision, a proposal can amend only one article of the constitution. A proposal for a new article can cover only one subject.</p><p>Galloway said she has long fought to root out corruption in Missouri, and thus, she supports the proposal.</p><p>McDowell vehemently opposes Clean Missouri, specifically because it “politicizes” the auditor’s office by giving it a hand in the redistricting process.</p></div>",

Cindy Hyde-Smith is hammering McDaniel over it.</p><p>That’s dangerous political territory for McDaniel, because Trump is exceedingly popular with Republicans.<br/><br/></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hyde-Smith and McDaniel are in a tense battle for Republican votes in Mississippi’s U.S. Senate race. McDaniel has asserted that Trump was pressured to endorse her by the Republican Party establishment, notably Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> “He endorsed me three times in 2014, so far he’s only endorsed her once,” McDaniel, a firebrand conservative state senator who narrowly lost to Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Mississippi, in 2014, said of Trump in an interview Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “It appears there is something is in play, it appears the establishment has a game in play there.”</p><p>McDaniel later told McClatchy that Trump “endorsed (the late Sen.) John McCain and (House Speaker) Paul Ryan for the same reasons. Our goal is to make sure that Donald Trump is his own man, and never has to cut these deals with Mitch McConnell again.”</p><p>A White House source familiar with the president’s thinking bristled at McDaniel’s assessment Friday afternoon, calling it “insulting.”</p><p>“The president makes his own decisions and it’s insulting and unhelpful for anyone to claim otherwise,” the source said. “Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith earned his trust and support, and the president is confident the people of Mississippi will make the right decision in November.”</p><p>McDaniel tried to offer Trump some praise.</p><p>“Trump is strong,” McDaniel said on MSNBC. “But he also needs 51 votes in the Senate. He’s trying to do the best he can to govern with a slim majority in the Senate.</p><p>“But ultimately,” McDaniel added, “he’s going to be much more pleased with conservatives that will actually fight for a living as opposed to those who will lay down and take shots.”</p><p><!-- %asset:218265240% --><br/><br/></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Melissa Scallan, a spokeswoman for Hyde-Smith’s campaign, said “Chris McDaniel has done nothing but insult the president in the last two weeks.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“First he said the president was manipulated into endorsing Cindy Hyde-Smith, then he said Donald Trump was forced into it,” said added.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">McDaniel, in an interview with McClatchy last month, suggested that Trump was pressured in to endorsing Hyde-Smith, a former Democrat, by McConnell.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“The people of Mississippi understand that President Trump occasionally has to cut deals by Mitch McConnell,” he said. “How else can you explain that he endorsed Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and John McCain? These are individuals who are hostile toward a President Trump, yet President Trump endorsed them.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He repeated <a href=\"http://thedmonline.com/chris-mcdaniel/\" target=\"_blank\">similar lines</a> at a town hall Thursday in Oxford, Miss. Hyde-Smith’s campaign called McDaniel’s comments insulting to Trump, who endorsed McDaniel’s 2014 Senate run.</p><p> <!-- %asset:218264925% --> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">McDaniel didn’t back down from his remarks on Friday.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“To anyone that says that President Trump isn’t being pressured by the swamp to cut deals with Mitch McConnell, I would ask them point blank to kindly explain why he would have endorsed his arch enemy, Mitt Romney,” McDaniel told McClatchy in an email Friday afternoon. “Mitt Romney called Donald Trump every name in the book, and yet when it came time for Romney to run for Senate, Donald Trump endorsed him.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:202262159% --> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Scallan said McDaniel is having “a difficult time accepting” that he didn’t get Trump’s backing.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“He is clearly in a state of denial, but I don’t know anyone who thinks the president can be forced to endorse anyone,” Scallan said Thursday.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">McDaniel, Hyde-Smith, and Democrat Mike Espy are running in a Nov. 6 special election to replace Cochran, who retired from the Senate in April citing health reasons. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hyde-Smith, Mississippi’s former agriculture commissioner, was appointed by Republican Gov.

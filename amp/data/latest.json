This is not written simply because Eric Berry’s health remains uncertain, or the defense looked awful in the preseason. This is a sober look at a team with a first-year starting quarterback, major questions on defense and perhaps most convincingly a line of personnel moves that are subtly but consistently pointing to a more serious push beginning in 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThis is not a hot take, in other words.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThis is the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eLook at the biggest moves. Alex Smith was traded for a Kendall Fuller, a young and rising cornerback, and draft picks, the higher of which comes next year. This happened because the team wanted to build around young quarterback Patrick Mahomes, a tantalizing talent but one who so far has only torched Big 12 defenses at Texas Tech.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eCornerback Marcus Peters was also traded, essentially because the organization was tired of repairing and reinforcing and worrying in his wake. Peters is young and game-changing and still cheap. You think a team that believes it’s close to a Super Bowl gives up on that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eOf course not, but a team that believes it’s close to a Super Bowl will trade for that, which is why the Rams added him to one of the league’s most talented rosters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThe free-agent moves were done with the future in mind, too. Sammy Watkins is just 25, and his red zone effectiveness (seven of his eight touchdowns last year were 17 yards or less) is seen as a complement to the 24-year-old Tyreek Hill (10 of his 13 career touchdown catches are 30 yards or more) to aid the development of the 22-year-old Mahomes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c!-- %asset:217921400% --\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eAnthony Hitchens is just 26, a three-down linebacker the Chiefs think pairs well with Reggie Ragland inside and, more importantly, can be a pillar aside Justin Houston and Eric Berry to strengthen what football people refer to as “the culture.” That’s not a quick fix.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eYou see the commonality here?

Their Bye Week is going to be painful. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt turns out I wasn’t the only one who panicked under pressure. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaylor drafted three defenses and three quarterbacks, and Kelsey forgot to draft a backup quarterback. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI feel good about my starting lineup — Deshaun Watson, Gurley, McCaffrey, Thomas, Jarvis Landry, Kelce, Sanders, Bears defense and Sebastian Janikowski. My bench is almost entirely players from OU, UNC or North Carolina: Adrian Peterson, Sterling Shepard, Tarik Cohen, Kenny Stills, Gio Bernard and Mitch Trubisky. Calvin Ridley rounds out the bench as the only non-NC or OU tie. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis week, I’m opening up the season against Kelsey (team name: Captain Kirk And The Giants). She’s ultra-competitive, so I’m already preparing to get my butt kicked. She’s starting Phillip Rivers — bolo tie and all — against KC’s secondary, so I like her chances even more. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","seo":{"keywords":"fantasy, football, fantasy football, NFL, Chiefs, Brooke Pryor, women, girls, Patriots, Browns"},"_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/stories/217916890?publication=kansascity"},"home_section":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/2694","asset":{"id":2694,"name":"Chiefs","taxonomy":"Sports|Football|Pro|NFL|","web_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/","unique_name":"kansas_city_chiefs","_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/2694"}}}},"home_publication":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/publications/kansascity"},"lead_media":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/images/217370675?publication=kansascity"},"related":[{"href":"/newsapi/v1/images/217370675?publication=kansascity"}]},"_embedded":{"inline":[{"id":217921400,"_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/videos/217921400?publication=kansascity"}}}]}}}},"publication":{"id":0,"long_name":"The Kansas City Star","short_name":"kansascity","time_zone":"","web_url":"","analytics":{"market_code":"","site_file":""},"_links":{"self":{"href":""}}},"published_date":"2018-09-06T17:36:44Z"},{"id":217923320,"title":"The Nike swoosh is out at Missouri’s College of the Ozarks because of Kaepernick ad","type":"story","_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/stories/217923320?publication=kansascity","asset":{"id":217923320,"web_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/article217923320.html","type":"story","title":"The Nike swoosh is out at Missouri’s College of the Ozarks because of Kaepernick ad","publication":{"short_name":"kansascity","long_name":"The Kansas City Star"},"modified_date":"2018-09-06T17:38:46Z","published_date":"2018-09-06T17:30:13Z","authors":[{"name":"Blair Kerkhoff","email":"bkerkhoff@kcstar.com"}],"summary":"\u003cdiv xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eAthletes at College of the Ozarks, a private, Christian, liberal arts school in Point Lookout, Missouri, will not wear Nike because of the shoe and apparel company’s Colin Kaepernick’s advertizing campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","body":"\u003cdiv xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eNike gear won’t be worn by athletic teams at College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Mo., in response to the shoe and apparel company’s Colin Kaepernick advertising campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“In their new ad campaign, we believe Nike executives are promoting an attitude of division and disrespect toward America,” College of the Ozarks President Jerry C.

The Patriots are the favorite at 5-to-1, with the Eagles and Rams both 8-to-1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat do the odds suggest about the statistical seasons the individual players might produce?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s start with Mahomes. They have the over/under lines listed at 3,750 yards, 23 touchdowns and 13 1/2 interceptions. Only four players have higher interception totals. But the ceiling on Mahomes remains relatively high. He’s listed at 60-to-1 to win the league’s most valuable player award, tied for the 20th best odds in the NFL. For comparison’s sake, Alex Smith had 4,042 yards, 26 touchdowns and five interceptions in 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRunning back Kareem Hunt led the league in rushing as a rookie last season, finishing with 1,327 yards, eight rushing touchdowns. His 2018 projections in Vegas are 1,150 rushing yards and 10 1/2 rushing touchdowns, per Bovada. Ten players have better odds to win the rushing title than Hunt, even though he holds the belt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe forecast for tight end Travis Kelce and wide receiver Tyreek Hill are quite similar. Each has their over/under for receiving yards listed at an even 1,000. Hill’s over/under for total touchdowns — receiving, rushing and returning combined — are seven. Kelce’s receiving touchdowns are listed at six. Hill had 1,183 yards and eight total touchdowns in 2017. Kelce had 1,038 yards and eight touchdowns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo why do the sports betting oddsmakers set Kelce and Hill with slightly worse outputs this year? A couple of factors are at play. First, they don’t believe Mahomes will repeat the season Smith had last year. And second, there is another player to split the touches with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIncoming wide receiver Sammy Watkins’ over/under for yards and touchdowns in his first season in Kansas City are 800 and 5 1/2, respectively. Those are much higher numbers than the Chiefs got from their No. 2 wide receiver a year ago. While Watkins caught eight scores last season, the yardage would be a significant bump in his production. Watkins had only 593 yards in 2017 with the Rams and just 430 yards in an injury-ravaged season in 2016. An injury, of course, would not negate the wager.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the defensive side, linebacker Justin Houston is calculated for eight sacks. Houston has proved one of the most difficult players for Vegas to set lines, given his injury history. He had 9 1/2 sacks in 2017 but only four in 2016 and just 7 1/2 in 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn their opener, the Chiefs are a 3 1/2-point underdog against the Chargers.\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"\u003e \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c!-- %asset:217344670% --\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","seo":{"keywords":"chiefs, wins, super bowl, odds, vegas, spread, line, 2018, nfl, season"},"_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/stories/217926665?publication=kansascity"},"home_section":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/2694","asset":{"id":2694,"name":"Chiefs","taxonomy":"Sports|Football|Pro|NFL|","web_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/","unique_name":"kansas_city_chiefs","_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/2694"}}}},"home_publication":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/publications/kansascity"},"lead_media":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/images/197245364?publication=kansascity"},"related":[{"href":"/newsapi/v1/images/197245364?publication=kansascity"}]},"_embedded":{"inline":[{"id":217344670,"_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/assets/217344670?publication=kansascity"}}},{"id":217586570,"_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/assets/217586570?publication=kansascity"}}}]}}}},"publication":{"id":0,"long_name":"The Kansas City Star","short_name":"kansascity","time_zone":"","web_url":"","analytics":{"market_code":"","site_file":""},"_links":{"self":{"href":""}}},"published_date":"2018-09-06T17:27:52Z"},{"id":217919770,"title":"Sports fans have made hilarious memes based on Nike’s new ‘Just Do It’ ad","type":"story","_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/stories/217919770?publication=kansascity","asset":{"id":217919770,"web_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/for-petes-sake/article217919770.html","type":"story","title":"Sports fans have made hilarious memes based on Nike’s new ‘Just Do It’ ad","publication":{"short_name":"kansascity","long_name":"The Kansas City Star"},"modified_date":"2018-09-06T17:06:01Z","published_date":"2018-09-06T16:47:45Z","authors":[{"name":"Pete Grathoff","email":"pgrathoff@kcstar.com"}],"summary":"\u003cdiv xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eNike’s “Just Do It” advertisement with a photo of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s picture has been made into memes by sports fans.

The plan goes to the full council Oct. 1 for consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There’s a lot of things that we don’t have that we’ve been asked about over the years,” Park Services Director Greg Ruether told the committee. “What new could go into this location?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe budget for the park improvements is $3 million and Ruether said the approved concept is designed to keep to that funding limit. Of the $3 million, $1 million is coming in a donation from retired car dealer Frank Thompson, a longtime philanthropist from Overland Park, and his wife Evangeline. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn Aug. 6, the city council approved an agreement that calls for Santa Fe Commons Park to be renamed Thompson Park once the upgrades are completed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmenities would include improved restrooms and shelters, a water feature with spray or mist, a contemporary children’s playground, natural play areas and space for table tennis, and a new open performance venue with a “paper airplane” shaped roof that would be a nod to Overland Park’s transportation past. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe conceptual plan was dubbed “Park Stroll,” by the Omaha-based RDG Planning \u0026amp; Design landscape architecture firm, which came up with \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article213247329.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efour concepts for the city\u003c/a\u003e to consider over the summer. Two concepts were for the park only, and two were for incorporating the farmers’ market into the park. Following several public forums and meetings with downtown business advocates and other stakeholders, Ruether said, the “Park Stroll” concept was the consensus choice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt would preserve the existing Carriage House, which dates from the early 1900s, and keep as many of the healthy trees as possible. It calls for replacing the deteriorating bandstand and broken sidewalks and fixing or replacing other aging infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBruce Niedermyer with RDG said the southern half of the park would remain as open and natural as possible, to create an urban lawn, almost like a “front yard,” for the nearby Santa Fe Towers apartments, whose many residents cherish the park and didn’t want substantial changes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRuether said he had appreciated his meeting with the Santa Fe Towers residents, describing them as “the nicest and most opinionated people.” He said the debate over moving the farmers’ market had been polarizing, but it was a useful discussion, and the feedback from \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article213247329.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewell over 100 city residents\u003c/a\u003e and other stakeholders had been crucial to the city’s decision on the best direction for the park. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany people felt shoehorning the farmers’ market into the park would reduce the desirable green space while also cramping the market. Parking was also a concern. City officials have determined that improving the market at its present location honors its 36-year history and is the best option, although those construction upgrades will have to be phased in over time to minimize disruptions to vendors and customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome residents now have a new concern: they’ve objected to the renaming, arguing it was done with no public input. They believe the Santa Fe Commons name should be preserved and is a better tie to Overland Park’s historical connection to the Santa Fe Trail. But the committee took no testimony on the renaming Wednesday night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbout three dozen people attended Wednesday’s public hearing, and several testified that they were relieved and pleased with the chosen concept.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think that can make a beautiful addition to our city,” said Linda McGuckin, who lives nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOthers questioned some of the elements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I treasure the fact that the park is natural,” said Rich Kaufman, adding that he thinks all the new park structures will detract from its natural character. He thought the “paper airplane” shaped roof for the performance space was silly and advised, “Get rid of that element. Make it a glider.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKaufman and several others also wondered why the park improvements need to occur now. They suggested the city should wait until multiple downtown construction projects are completed in a few years to see if park changes are really needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Councilman Paul Lyons opposed waiting and said the city can coordinate the park construction with other projects to try to reduce parking problems and inconvenience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think we should go full steam ahead,” he said. “I think it’s going to be a great amenity.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the council approves the concept, more detailed designs go to the Overland Park Planning Commission, probably late this year or early next year. Ruether said the schedule calls for construction in 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","seo":{"keywords":"Overland Park, Santa Fe Commons, park, farmers' market, development, improvements, stroll, playground, downtown"},"_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/stories/217887490?publication=kansascity"},"home_section":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/2595","asset":{"id":2595,"name":"Government \u0026 Politics","taxonomy":"News|Local|GovtPolitics||","web_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/","unique_name":"politics_government","_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/2595"}}}},"home_publication":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/publications/kansascity"},"lead_media":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/images/217917550?publication=kansascity"},"related":[{"href":"/newsapi/v1/images/217917550?publication=kansascity"},{"href":"/newsapi/v1/videos/177437931?publication=kansascity"},{"href":"/newsapi/v1/images/217916990?publication=kansascity"},{"href":"/newsapi/v1/stories/217438320?publication=kansascity"}]},"_embedded":{"inline":null}}}},"publication":{"id":0,"long_name":"The Kansas City Star","short_name":"kansascity","time_zone":"","web_url":"","analytics":{"market_code":"","site_file":""},"_links":{"self":{"href":""}}},"published_date":"2018-09-06T16:46:31Z"},{"id":217915210,"title":"‘We’re glad to have him’: Missouri GOP on Billy Long auctioneering away protester","type":"story","_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/stories/217915210?publication=kansascity","asset":{"id":217915210,"web_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/missouri/article217915210.html","type":"story","title":"‘We’re glad to have him’: Missouri GOP on Billy Long auctioneering away protester","publication":{"short_name":"kansascity","long_name":"The Kansas City Star"},"modified_date":"2018-09-06T16:42:15Z","published_date":"2018-09-06T16:17:34Z","authors":[{"name":"Matt Campbell","email":"mcampbell@kcstar.com"}],"summary":"\u003cdiv xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eMissouri Congressman Billy Long, a Republican from Springfield, drew laughs Wednesday by using his auctioneering skill to drown out a protester during a House hearing on free speech.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","body":"\u003cdiv xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eU.S. Rep.

Really loud.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe unbeaten Chiefs will make their 2018 home debut Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers, and it will be the first home start of quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ career. Kickoff is at noon and the game is on WDAF (Ch. 4).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHaving knocked off the preseason AFC West favorite Chargers and long-time nemesis Pittsburgh, both on the road, the Chiefs are likely to be fired up for the game, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn fact, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickMahomes5/status/1041445889510920194\"\u003eMahomes tweeted\u003c/a\u003e after Sunday’s win over the Steelers: “We are just getting started..!

The Niners won their last five games and many expected they’d make the postseason behind Garoppolo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut in the 49ers’ opener, Garoppolo threw three interceptions in a loss at Minnesota. On Sunday, San Francisco beat the Lions 30-27 but Garoppolo dodged a bullet. Nursing that three-point lead late in the game, the Lions’ Tracy Walker intercepted a pass that was returned to the San Francisco 7. Garoppolo was bailed out by a defensive holding call on the other side of the field.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGaroppolo has completed 33 of 59 passes for 467 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions this season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMeet Matt Breida\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSan Francisco running back Matt Breida rushed for 138 yards against the Lions and broke off a 66-yard touchdown scamper that was the 49ers’ longest TD run in four seasons. A big block aided Breida:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:218528265% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBreida, who is in his second season after signing as an undrafted free agent out of Georgia Southern, has 22 rushing attempts this season for 184 yards. Former Washington running back Alfred Morris has 86 yards rushing in 26 attempts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRed Zone troubles\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 49ers made five trips to the red zone against the Lions but had to settle for a field goal three times. Garoppolo was sacked three times on those three drives that ended in field goals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgainst the Vikings in the opener, San Francisco got to the red zone four times. Here is what happened:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. Morris fumbled at the 1\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. Settled for a 33-yard field goal\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3.

Had to kick a 22-yard field goal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo that’s nine trips to the red zone and just three touchdowns scored this season for the Niners.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRichard Sherman\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 49ers signed cornerback Richard Sherman this summer. He was a four-time Pro Bowler, a first-team All-Pro three times and won a Super Bowl with the Seattle Seahawks before coming to San Francisco.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSherman made two tackles Sunday against the Lions and recovered a fumble in the 49ers’ season opener at Minnesota.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHeading into Monday night’s game, the 49ers rank 23rd in pass defense (278 yards per game) and are tied for the fourth-most touchdown passes allowed. Two of the top three are teams the Chiefs have played: Pittsburgh at No. 1 and the Chargers are tied for second with the Bills.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA new receiver?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1041328126813458432\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eESPN’s Adam Schefter reported\u003c/a\u003e that the Cleveland Browns are expected to trade wide receiver Josh Gordon and hope to send him to a team in the NFC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGordon can’t dictate where the Browns will trade him, but he would like to go to Dallas or San Francisco, Schefter reported.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/49ers/article/John-Lynch-49ers-have-called-about-Browns-WR-13233684.php\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSan Francisco Chronicle reported\u003c/a\u003e that 49ers general manager John Lynch has contacted the Browns about Gordon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","seo":{"keywords":"Chiefs, preview, 49ers, San Francisco, Patrick Mahomes, Arrowhead Stadium, game, NFL, matchup"},"_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/stories/218528170?publication=kansascity"},"home_section":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/6607","asset":{"id":6607,"name":"For Pete's Sake","taxonomy":"Sports||||","web_url":"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/for-petes-sake/","unique_name":"for_petes_sake","_links":{"self":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/sections/6607"}}}},"home_publication":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/publications/kansascity"},"lead_media":{"href":"/newsapi/v1/videos/218529910?publication=kansascity","asset":{"id":218529910,"brightcove_id":"5835840049001","title":"One Minute Preview: San Francisco 49ers","description":"Here are five things to know about the San Francisco 49ers before they take on the Kansas City Chiefs  in Week Three of the 2018 NFL season.

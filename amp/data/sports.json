This is not written simply because Eric Berry’s health remains uncertain, or the defense looked awful in the preseason. This is a sober look at a team with a first-year starting quarterback, major questions on defense and perhaps most convincingly a line of personnel moves that are subtly but consistently pointing to a more serious push beginning in 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThis is not a hot take, in other words.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThis is the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eLook at the biggest moves. Alex Smith was traded for a Kendall Fuller, a young and rising cornerback, and draft picks, the higher of which comes next year. This happened because the team wanted to build around young quarterback Patrick Mahomes, a tantalizing talent but one who so far has only torched Big 12 defenses at Texas Tech.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eCornerback Marcus Peters was also traded, essentially because the organization was tired of repairing and reinforcing and worrying in his wake. Peters is young and game-changing and still cheap. You think a team that believes it’s close to a Super Bowl gives up on that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eOf course not, but a team that believes it’s close to a Super Bowl will trade for that, which is why the Rams added him to one of the league’s most talented rosters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThe free-agent moves were done with the future in mind, too. Sammy Watkins is just 25, and his red zone effectiveness (seven of his eight touchdowns last year were 17 yards or less) is seen as a complement to the 24-year-old Tyreek Hill (10 of his 13 career touchdown catches are 30 yards or more) to aid the development of the 22-year-old Mahomes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c!-- %asset:217921400% --\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eAnthony Hitchens is just 26, a three-down linebacker the Chiefs think pairs well with Reggie Ragland inside and, more importantly, can be a pillar aside Justin Houston and Eric Berry to strengthen what football people refer to as “the culture.” That’s not a quick fix.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eYou see the commonality here? Get younger, create stable support for a first-year starting quarterback and build a culture that will help rather than impede.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThe truth is the Chiefs’ defense probably had too many holes to fix all in one offseason, but certain circumstances also played against them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThe Chiefs may have prioritized Bears cornerback Kyle Fuller in free agency, and if so it would have been on brand. He’s Kendall’s brother, another dependable teammate, and he would’ve strengthened a premium position.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c!-- %asset:217586570% --\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eBut after the Bears used their franchise tag on Fuller, the backup options were less enticing.

The Chiefs will have an extra second-round pick next year, and will likely draft at least one cornerback high.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eIf that’s the way it goes, the biggest concern going forward could be the pass rush. The Chiefs need as much as they can get from Houston as he enters his 30s, and more importantly they need some real production from a second rusher.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eDee Ford is the most likely to make an impact in 2018, but he’s inconsistent, with unreliable health, can be a liability against the run, and will be a free agent after the season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c!-- %asset:217768120% --\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eRookie Breeland Speaks may be better suited inside — he played there in college, and could make an effective tandem with Chris Jones rushing in sub packages. If that’s the way it goes, the Chiefs would need some combination of retaining Ford, getting regular production from Tanoh Kpassagnoh, drafting a pass rusher high, or picking through a free agent class that could include Jadeveon Clowney.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThe other thing going on here is a tangible priority on the defensive front, perhaps influenced by the current Super Bowl champions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThe discussion around the Eagles’ run typically centers around (Reid protege) Doug Pederson’s creativity, and that’s obviously a critical element.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eBut the Eagles also won with a defense that ranked fourth in points, fourth in yards and second in Football Outsiders’ DVOA with a group of corners that nobody would envy.

The Chiefs could try to emulate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eEither way, the Chiefs are approaching this as more than a quick fix. That may mean fewer wins in 2018.

In fact, you should probably do the opposite of whatever I do. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead, this is a (hopefully) weekly peek inside my all-girls fantasy football league.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, 59.3 million people played fantasy sports in the U.S. and Canada, according to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association. The largest chunk — 71 percent — were male, leaving women to make up the remaining 29 percent. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m happy to say that I’m one of the 29 percent, along with the nine other women in my league. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFounded by my friend Kelsey, we’ve been doing the all-girls league for four years now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe league, “Run the World: GRILS” — yes, girls is misspelled, no we don’t know why we haven’t fixed it over the years — is pretty low-stakes. Some years we haven’t wagered any money. This year, we’re doing a $20 buy-in. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are 10 players this year, and I only know four of them — Kelsey, Sarah, Erika and Taylor — in real life. The rest are connected through Kelsey and Sarah, whom I became friends with during a study abroad semester in college. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c!-- %asset:217921400% --\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe group is a diverse one.

You’d think a football writer would have an unfair advantage in a fantasy football league. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’d also be wrong. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo be clear, I’m not bad because I don’t understand how it works. I’m bad because I’m a big softy. I draft guys who I’ve covered and ones who I have a genuine interest in following off the field. It mimics my approach for telling stories on the beats I cover, which works great for reporting and not so much for competitive fantasy football leagues. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast year Erika — team name Gurley Show — won the league, and Sarah came in second. Laura, known this year as Gronk A Donk, was third. Honestly, I have no idea where I finished, but I know that I didn’t win any money. Based on the fact that I had the third pick this year, I’m guessing I was somewhere toward the bottom. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith my drafting habits, I know that’s shocking. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know some fantasy leagues have elaborate draft ceremonies and make an event out of it. That’s not what we did. Kelsey, the commissioner, sent out an email Sunday night to schedule it. We exchanged emails in a thread through Monday afternoon and hastily decided that Monday night worked best for all of us. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause Sarah was catching a flight and others had other fantasy drafts, Kelsey gave us 30 seconds per pick. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTalk about stress. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can’t pick out what scented candle I want at Target in 30 seconds, much less decide on which players will help me to a yet another mediocre finish. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy team — Post Mahomes — started out on a strong note, picking up Todd Gurley with my first selection. As a fellow North Carolinian, Gurley fits my rule of drafting guys I have some kind of connection to. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn between rounds, I tried to FaceTime my fiancé for some advice, but things were moving so quickly that I got stressed and ended the call before he could really help. Big mistake. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe did advise me to draft Christian McCaffrey, which I did. I briefly covered McCaffrey’s brother, Max, at Duke, so it still adheres to my draft method. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the next round, I finally put my NFL knowledge to use. I was torn between drafting Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, but ultimately went with Kelce because I think he’ll get more targets than Hill based on the preseason. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I started to panic in the 30-second windows.\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"\u003eI drafted both \u003c/span\u003eDemaryius Thomas\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003eand Emmanuel Sanders in back-to-back rounds. I don’t have a good explanation for it, either. I was about to autodraft a defense out of my cue in the seventh round, and I saw Sanders’ name on the list of top available players, so I just pulled the trigger with a second left. Their Bye Week is going to be painful. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt turns out I wasn’t the only one who panicked under pressure. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaylor drafted three defenses and three quarterbacks, and Kelsey forgot to draft a backup quarterback. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI feel good about my starting lineup — Deshaun Watson, Gurley, McCaffrey, Thomas, Jarvis Landry, Kelce, Sanders, Bears defense and Sebastian Janikowski. My bench is almost entirely players from OU, UNC or North Carolina: Adrian Peterson, Sterling Shepard, Tarik Cohen, Kenny Stills, Gio Bernard and Mitch Trubisky. Calvin Ridley rounds out the bench as the only non-NC or OU tie. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis week, I’m opening up the season against Kelsey (team name: Captain Kirk And The Giants). She’s ultra-competitive, so I’m already preparing to get my butt kicked.

The Patriots are the favorite at 5-to-1, with the Eagles and Rams both 8-to-1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat do the odds suggest about the statistical seasons the individual players might produce?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s start with Mahomes. They have the over/under lines listed at 3,750 yards, 23 touchdowns and 13 1/2 interceptions. Only four players have higher interception totals. But the ceiling on Mahomes remains relatively high. He’s listed at 60-to-1 to win the league’s most valuable player award, tied for the 20th best odds in the NFL. For comparison’s sake, Alex Smith had 4,042 yards, 26 touchdowns and five interceptions in 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRunning back Kareem Hunt led the league in rushing as a rookie last season, finishing with 1,327 yards, eight rushing touchdowns. His 2018 projections in Vegas are 1,150 rushing yards and 10 1/2 rushing touchdowns, per Bovada. Ten players have better odds to win the rushing title than Hunt, even though he holds the belt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe forecast for tight end Travis Kelce and wide receiver Tyreek Hill are quite similar. Each has their over/under for receiving yards listed at an even 1,000. Hill’s over/under for total touchdowns — receiving, rushing and returning combined — are seven. Kelce’s receiving touchdowns are listed at six. Hill had 1,183 yards and eight total touchdowns in 2017. Kelce had 1,038 yards and eight touchdowns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo why do the sports betting oddsmakers set Kelce and Hill with slightly worse outputs this year? A couple of factors are at play. First, they don’t believe Mahomes will repeat the season Smith had last year. And second, there is another player to split the touches with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIncoming wide receiver Sammy Watkins’ over/under for yards and touchdowns in his first season in Kansas City are 800 and 5 1/2, respectively. Those are much higher numbers than the Chiefs got from their No. 2 wide receiver a year ago. While Watkins caught eight scores last season, the yardage would be a significant bump in his production. Watkins had only 593 yards in 2017 with the Rams and just 430 yards in an injury-ravaged season in 2016. An injury, of course, would not negate the wager.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the defensive side, linebacker Justin Houston is calculated for eight sacks. Houston has proved one of the most difficult players for Vegas to set lines, given his injury history.

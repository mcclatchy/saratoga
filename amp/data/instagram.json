And then her life was no more. </p><p>Global Instagram model <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sineadmcnamara/\" target=\"_self\">Sinead McNamara</a> was found unconscious Friday on a superyacht docked in Greece, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/04/australia/sinead-mcnamara-yacht-death-intl/index.html\" target=\"_self\">CNN reports</a>. </p><p>The 20-year-old native Australian had reportedly been working as a crew member on the ship owned by Mexican mining billionaire Alberto Baillères. He was not on board, according to widespread media reports. </p><p> <!-- %asset:217898240% --> </p><p>The Mayan Queen IV was anchored off the island of Kefalonia; other crew members discovered the woman tangled in some rope off the side of the boat. She still had a pulse, but died en route to the hospital.</p><p>A coroner told CNN on Tuesday that her death was ruled a hanging.</p><p>Local Greek media site <a href=\"http://www.inkefalonia.gr/koinonia/64714-apopeira-aftoktonias-se-thalamigo-sto-argostoli\" target=\"_self\">Inkefalonia.gr </a>also reported that it was an “attempted suicide,” before she died. </p><p>According to the<a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/incidents/failed-relationship-focus-for-police-in-sinead-mcnamara-death-inquiry/news-story/ce2705668661c6437662fba9b5dd3075\" target=\"_self\"> News.com.au, </a>McNamara had recently gone through a bad breakup. </p><p>“She was upset and made comments about a relationship ending or some sort of trouble in her private life,” the source told the Aussie media outlet. </p><p>The woman’s last post was on Aug. 27, off the Greek coastline. Many sent their condolences. </p><p> <!-- %asset:217898200% --> </p><p>“R.I.P. beautiful angel,” wrote one.</p><p>Another poster couldn’t help but mention the irony: “I hope that it‘s not true, but i must say, if this girl really got suicidal, it‘s crazy but i think she just had such a perfect life, that she couldn’t take a heartbreaking end of a relationship.”</p><p>And yet another mentioned that social media love isn’t exactly the real thing. </p><p>“[F]ollowers can’t bring happiness. Please, reach out to someone if you’re ever feeling that there is no other choice. Spread the love.”</p></div>",

He is accused of killing Ashley Harlan, 23, inside a relative’s townhouse that she had recently moved into in the 1200 block of East Westerfield Place.</p><p>Wash was the one who <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article197782504.html\" target=\"_self\">called 911 on Jan. 30</a> to report finding her dead, according to testimony.</p><p>He told police that he had last spoken to Harlan the night before.</p><p>On the 30th, Wash said he had been at work and tried to call and text Harlan multiple times during the day. After work, he picked up his daughter and drove to Harlan’s house, he said.</p><p>Wash told police that the front door was closed but not locked.</p><p>After finding Harlan’s body, Wash said, he saw the blinds in front of a back sliding door moving and said the door was slightly ajar, according to testimony.</p><p>The first Olathe police officers on the scene said they did not find any signs of forced entry. </p><p>Wash cooperated with police, giving a lengthy interview to detectives. He allowed them to search his phone and car and take DNA samples from him, officers testified.</p><p>As possible suspects, Wash gave police the names of two other men with whom Harlan had had relationships.</p><p>One of those men also lived in Olathe, and Harlan was afraid of him, Wash told police.</p><p>The other man mentioned by Wash had been involved romantically with Harlan. In the past, Wash had argued with Harlan about her relationship with him, according to testimony.</p><p>Wash also told police that he had scolded Harlan previously for her habit of leaving doors unlocked or telling people she didn’t know that she was going to be home alone.</p><p>As prosecutors began laying out evidence Monday, they noted that Wash had failed to tell police several things, including that he was seeing another woman besides Harlan.</p><p>Wash also did not mention leaving work early on the day Harlan’s body was found, according to testimony.</p><p>The preliminary hearing is scheduled to continue Tuesday in front of District Judge Charles Droege, who will decide if there is sufficient evidence for the case to proceed to trial.</p><p>The charge carries a potential death sentence. Prosecutors do not have to declare if they plan to seek the death penalty for Wash until after the preliminary hearing.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217164535% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>The preparation commenced last fall, as Patrick Mahomes sat in the same quarterbacks room with Alex Smith day after day. It accelerated over training camp this summer, after Mahomes had assumed the starting job in Kansas City. He took dozens of snaps in practice, rolled with the first team in three preseason games and received significant attention from offensive-minded coaches.</p><p>But no matter the amount of time or facets allocated toward Mahomes’ development, there were aspects of it that remained unknown until the real games arrived.</p><p>His response to pressure in the pocket. His response to a defense that disguised and diversified its looks.</p><p>So far, so good. A day after Mahomes tied a franchise record with six touchdowns in the 42-37 win in Pittsburgh, Chiefs coach Andy Reid started there.</p><p> <!-- %asset:218539425% --> </p><p>“The thing that I think gets overlooked in this one is they threw a bunch at him,” Reid said Monday of the Steelers’ defense. “Which I thought was going to be an important thing for him to work with.”</p><p>The film room identifies the coverages and the sources of potential blitzes and pressures. The Chiefs spent considerable time helping<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>Mahomes distinguish them.</p><p>But he doesn’t get hit in practice. The risk of standing in the pocket isn’t elevated in the same manner it is during a game.</p><p>Reid said Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Keith Butler “threw the kitchen sink” at the Chiefs with different pressures. To be sure, the offensive line deserves a major share of the credit for that being a non-factor, which Reid, Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce were quick to point out.</p><p>But Mahomes earned his share, too. Rather than scrambling and breaking the plan of a play, he manipulated the pocket.</p><p>“For a young guy, you wanna see how he handles the blitz and/or any pressure (and) how he settles in the pocket,” Reid said. “There are subtle things that can take place off of a three-technique or a one-technique. And if you’re getting a little pressure there, how do you move and still keep your eyes downfield? There are a bunch of little things in there that take place.</p><p>“Until you’re live — until you take that yellow jersey off — you’re not sure exactly. We get to see it here, (and) he seems to be doing that pretty good.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p>A couple of plays — one from each of the first two weeks — serve as a prime example.</p><p>On Sunday in Pittsburgh, Mahomes had Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt bearing down on him. The play call was actually a run-pass option, meaning Mahomes could have simply handed the ball to Kareem Hunt and avoided a hit. Instead, he faked the handoff, then fired to Tyreek Hill for first-down yardage.</p><p>It mirrored a similar sequence against the Los Angeles Chargers in the opener.</p><p>“He’s done that the last couple weeks. He’s pretty good with that,” Reid said. “There’s going to be games where he’s going to have to maneuver some things, but he’s doing that right now. And the line’s giving him enough time right now, which is an important thing for a young quarterback.”</p><p>As for the coverages, Mahomes was able to shift the secondary with his eyes. He did it on each of the touchdowns to Kelce.</p><p>His reads have been true. Well, for the most part. Moments after Reid said the amount of nuance encountering Mahomes on Sunday might have been overlooked, he finished the same thought with acknowledgment that not all of it was handled perfectly — that even after a six-touchdown day, there remains opportunity for development.</p><p>“He’s using his instincts. He’s using his guys. He’s seeing it right now,” Reid said. “He’s just gotta keep growing with that. There were some things that he could’ve done better. I don’t wanna take anything away from him, but he’s a young kid, man, and he’s learning as we go. You’re seeing it. There’s room for improvement there.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:217344670% --> </p></div>",

Clean Missouri submitted more than 340,000 signatures asking that the proposal go on the November ballot.</p><p>They all understand what Green does not: In Missouri, ballot initiatives must be interpreted broadly, with every close call going to the people — not legislators, lobbyists or judges. </p><p>“The trial court’s judgment must be reversed because it misapplied the law,” Clean Missouri supporters told the appeals court in a brief filed over the weekend. “The people should be allowed to vote on the wisdom of the measure.”</p><p>We agree.

She could not remember when she first met Kunze, but she said Sheriff Jeff Easter had just been elected. Easter was elected in 2012. </p><p>“Kunze wasn’t just an anonymous face to me,” Lee posted to Facebook. “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/teresa.lee.94849/posts/10101824204930952?__tn__=K-R\" target=\"_blank\">He wasn’t just another deputy</a>.” </p><p>Kunze was her primary field training officer, she said, and as a volunteer, she worked with many officers. </p><p>But Kunze was different. </p><p><!-- %asset:218556045% --> <br/><br/></p><p>“I know people say this when people pass away — they say, ‘Oh, he was a nice guy’ — but he was a super nice guy who always had a smile on his face, always making jokes, always laughing,” she continued. “I knew no matter how frustrated or overwhelmed I was, I knew I’d have a good day because I was with Kunze.”<br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:218552875% --> </p><p>During Sunday’s news conference regarding the shooting, Easter said the department will remember Kunze for “his smile, his contagious laugh and his ability to engage anyone and everyone in a conversation.” </p><p>He also worked with great pride, Easter said. </p><p>Kunze, 41, joined the department in 2006 after previously working with the Shawnee County Sheriff’s Office for six years. </p><p>“It’s such a devastating lost because he was a good deputy,” Lee said. “He was personable, able to talk to people with the greatest ease, he had a ton of knowledge...” </p><p>Easter said the deputy’s death is a tragedy. </p><p>“A family member of ours has been killed in the line of duty,” he said on Sunday. </p><p>Other employees with the sheriff’s office were not ready to speak about this loss, sheriff’s spokesman Lt. Tim Meyers said. </p><p>“This tragedy is very much an open wound for all of the employees of the Sheriff’s Office,” he said. </p><p>Kunze is survived by his wife and daughter. </p><p>The sheriff’s office is hosting a<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1922496188051506/\" target=\"_blank\"> candlelight vigil for Kunze</a> at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Wichita/Sedgwick Law Enforcement Memorial in front of Wichita’s City Hall near Central and Main.</p><p>Funeral services for Deputy Robert K.

Justin Hughes and Cody Fletcher, a pair of unheralded linebackers not listed on the depth chart, played meaningful snaps. And Eli Walker made his first start at strong safety.</p><p>Those moves were anything but one-time personnel changes made during a lopsided victory. All of those players may be needed again this week in a pressure-packed game at West Virginia.</p><p>Injuries have already hit the Wildcats hard on defense, and they could be down several key players when they take on the No. 12 Mountaineers and their explosive offense. A tough test just got even more difficult.</p><p>“That’s probably one of the worst teams you could line up short-handed against,” K-State coach Bill Snyder said. “They’re a very prolific offense, which they’ve proven over time — not just this year, year in and year out — and they have developed a great deal of balance in their offense.”</p><p>Here are the K-State defensive players who may not be healthy enough to play this weekend:</p><ul><li>Denzel Goolsby: The junior strong safety from Wichita is expected to miss at least a handful more games while he recovers from an unspecified injury sustained against Mississippi State. He wasn’t even on the sideline for the UTSA game. Walker, who made five tackles against the Roadrunners, is the next man up.</li><li>Elijah Sullivan: K-State has taken things slow with the junior linebacker as he recovered from a preseason knee injury. Though he is arguably the best linebacker on the roster, he came off the bench in the first two games and didn’t play at all against UTSA. Consider him questionable this week. If he is unable to play against the Mountaineers, the Wildcats will need strong efforts from Sam Sizelove, Hughes and Fletcher.</li><li>Kevion McGee: The junior defensive back was a pleasant surprise for the Wildcats when he broke up a team high four passes against South Dakota. But he has rarely played since and didn’t see the field against UTSA. Snyder said he is dealing with an injury and is not sure when he will return. Without him, K-State’s secondary has struggled to find depth.</li></ul><p>Those potential absences create new challenges for K-State, which will have its hands full with West Virginia’s offense.</p><p>With Heisman Trophy contender Will Grier at quarterback, dynamic playmakers Gary Jennings and David Sills at receiver and Leddie Brown at running back, the Mountaineers are hard for any defense (even at full strength) to stop.</p><p>West Virginia is averaging 586 yards and 46 points per game.</p><p>The new faces on K-State’s defense will need to mature quickly.</p><p>“Being short-handed is not something you envision and something you want,” Snyder said, “but we’re no different than anybody else. If you have somebody that has to step up and play in place of someone they have to be well prepared to do as well as the other one. It’s the next-up thought, probably, but that’s what you do when you coach. You get guys prepared to step into those situations.”</p></div>",

No criminal charges were filed in the shooting. </p><p>Stokes-James <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article104808311.html\" target=\"_self\">had previously complained to the Police Department </a>about the inaccuracy of the language in the commendation.</p><p>On Monday, she issued a statement saying the awards have caused her family “tremendous pain.”</p><p>“Today the Police Department has taken the first step to admitting they lied about my son,” the statement read. “(Officer) Thompson shot my unarmed son in the back and his actions can never be justified.”</p><p>Stokes-James said she had not been told in advance of the announcement by the police board. </p><p>“I am sad that they did not think enough of me or of my son to invite me to attend this meeting.”</p><p>Police have said the shooting was deemed reasonable because Stokes was fleeing from police and Thompson thought he saw a gun in Stokes’ hand. </p><p>Witnesses told police they saw Stokes <a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article324232/Man-shot-by-police-had-just-tossed-his-gun-away.html\" target=\"_blank\">toss away a gun moments before</a> the shooting. Investigators concluded that Stokes put the gun in the car just before he was shot.</p><p>A grand jury declined to indict Thompson, and a police shooting panel that reviewed the incident made no recommendations for training or department policy changes.</p><p>Cynthia Short, a lawyer who is representing Stokes-James in the suit, said the officers involved in the incident had been working in administrative roles and were not prepared for their assignment that night working in “hot spot” locations such as the Power &amp; Light District.<br/><br/></p><p>Short said the Police Department lied about what happened. </p><p>“Virtually everything they said that happened in that parking lot was untrue,” Short said. “From the very first moment that they had an opportunity to speak to this community, they have been telling lies about what happened there that night, and lies about Ryan.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:52412615% --></p><p>Community leaders have called for more accountability, transparency and reforms in the Police Department. <br/><br/></p><p>Some have proposed creating a safer foot-pursuit policy and appointing a victim advocate team that would reach out to survivors of police shootings and families of those killed. </p><p>Relatives of Stokes and community leaders have made a habit of attending monthly police board meetings, asking police commissioners to rescind the award, clear Stokes’ name and implement their reforms. </p><p>Among the community leaders speaking out about the Stokes shooting has been the Rev. Vernon Howard, president of the <a href=\"https://www.sclcgkc.org/\" target=\"_self\">Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Kansas City. </a></p><p>“As a civil rights organization, our interest is the victim’s (Mr. Stokes’) rights. To the extent this rescinding assists in reversing the false and very unfair public criminalization of Mr. Stokes then this decision is good,” Howard said Monday. </p><p>“However, the narrative that Mr. Stokes was a threat is untrue and still needs addressing.”</p><p>“This young African American male was a noble and positive contributor to his daughter, family, church, and community. To our knowledge his daughter and family have yet to receive a proper and full restorative response,” Howard said.</p><p> <!-- %asset:104810061% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Blue Valley Northwest senior Christian Braun hails from Burlington, Kan., the home of former Kansas basketball player Tyrel Reed.</p><p>“As a matter of fact, Tyrel’s sister, Lacie, used to babysit my boys. Christian used to put his high-tops on and walk around in them all the time. It was cute,” Lisa Braun said Monday after her son, Christian, orally committed to play at Reed’s alma mater.</p><p><span class=\"s1\">Braun, a </span>combo guard/small forward who is Rivals.com’s No. 112-rated player in the recruiting Class of 2019, chose KU over Kansas State, Illinois, Missouri and others.</p><p><span class=\"s1\">Christian’s brother, Parker, is a freshman forward at Missouri — alma mater of Lisa Braun, who moved with her husband, Donald, and the kids to Overland Park for the start of Christian’s high school career four years ago.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“He’s always been a KU fan since he was little, just because of the area we grew up in and his dad went to KU,” the former Lisa Sandbothe said of Christian. “There’s always been the Border War in our house of course, because I played at Mizzou. The Border War continues,” she added with a laugh.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Parker Braun, a 6-8 freshman, and Christian, who stands 6-6, both played for the MoKan Elite AAU team as well as Blue Valley Northwest. Parker — he was not recruited by KU — will be placed on scholarship at Mizzou starting his sophomore season. No scholarships were available for 2018-19.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Christian Braun’s commitment to KU completed a whirlwind couple of weeks for the two-time state champion who averaged 14.2 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.1 assists a game his junior year at BV Northwest.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Christian — he played quite well at the Peach Jam in South Carolina and a tourney in Las Vegas to conclude the summer AAU circuit — was offered a scholarship by KU on Aug. 30 during his unofficial campus visit.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">At that time, he also had offers from MU, Oklahoma, K-State, Texas Tech, Wake Forest and others.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">KU coach Bill Self and assistant Norm Roberts held an in-home visit with the Braun family on Sunday night in Overland Park and Christian offered his commitment just hours later on Monday.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“We discussed where they thought I would fit in and stuff like that,” Braun said Monday.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“It feels right for me and my family. KU has always been a place I wanted to go. I grew up in a small town in Kansas. It’s always been a dream for me. I’m pretty excited for the opportunity when I got it. I figured I should take it and go from there,” Braun added.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Braun made the announcement shortly before 2 p.m. Monday, with this post on Twitter: “First I would like to thank my parents for loving me and caring for me throughout my life and sacrificing everything to put me in the best position for my future. I would also like to thank my coaches for guiding me throughout this process. I would like to thank MoKan for giving me a platform to showcase my ability for the past six years. I am committing to the University of Kansas!”</span></p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p>Braun, who made one official visit, to K-State, was to have traveled to Oklahoma this coming weekend and Illinois in October. Instead he’s committed to sign a letter-of-intent with KU in November.</p><p><span class=\"s1\">“Talking to Coach Self and Roberts … it seems the right fit for me and my family,” Christian Braun said. “I really like the coaching staff. I met the players. I really like them. Obviously I’ve been a KU fan a long time. It seemed to be the right place for me. I can help the program. I think it’s going to be special.”</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">He has talked to Self about the role he’ll play at KU.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“I am more a 2,” he said. “I play a lot of the 2 and 3 and also a bit of 1 if he needs it. Just versatility is something me and coach talk about a lot.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“Right now I’m taking it all in,” added Braun. “I don’t know it’s necessarily hit me yet. Just the opportunity being that it’s Kansas. Once everything settles down I’ll be able to look at it. I’m just pretty excited.”</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Lisa Braun (she indicated the family’s last name is pronounced Brown) said she’s happy she’ll have two sons playing major college basketball in the area.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“They’ve been watching him for years,” Lisa said of KU coaches attending MoKan Elite games and BV Northwest contests. “They’d see him whenever he went to team camps at KU with Coach Fritz (Ed, BV Northwest). Our family … we’re just basketball fans in general. I don’t think we’re real particular of what school or whatever, we just like good ball. That’s what he (Self) is known for. He’s done a super job. You can’t beat the statistics the Jayhawks have had over the years. And we trust him. He’s a go-getter, a class act guy. I don’t think he (Christian) could have picked a better coach,” Lisa added.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"> Proud MU Tiger Lisa would love to see KU and MU play again, especially with sons at both institutions.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“Oh yes. If we can’t have them play together, it’s always fun to have both kids on the same court,” Lisa Braun said.</span></p><p>Braun’s commitment is KU’s first from a prospect in the Class of 2019. The Jayhawks will have at least one more scholarship available after the departure of senior Lagerald Vick. More scholarships are expected to be available with several non-seniors likely to consider entering the 2019 NBA Draft.</p><p><!-- %asset:217344780% --><br/><br/></p></div>",

But don’t try to sell me that 78-0 to Michigan or 80-7 to West Virginia was worse than this, any of those dispiriting Villanova or New Hampshire losses were worse than this, or anything else in recent memory tops what happened here on Saturday afternoon for rock bottom. </p><p>“The Scarlet Knights came to Kansas and got run out of the building by the team that was supposed to be — emphasis on<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>supposed to be<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>— the worst Power 5 team in the country. I think, after the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>Jayhawks’ 55-14 victory, we clearly know which program has earned that title now. ...</p><p>“Rutgers embarrassed itself on Saturday. Rutgers was completely unprepared to play against a team that loss to Nicholls State in its opener and just snapped a 46-game road losing streak last week. Rutgers was steamrolled by a program that exists so the kind folks have a way to pass the time until basketball season out here.” </p><p>Whew, that’s harsh. </p><p>But Politi wasn’t the only one to rip Rutgers for the loss.</p><p>Aaron Breitman wrote a story on SB Nation’s Rutgers blog with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.onthebanks.com/2018/9/16/17864768/rutgers-football-alarm-bells-ring-in-epic-loss-to-kansas-chris-ash-pat-hobbs-big-ten-ohio-state\" target=\"_blank\">“Rutgers Football: Alarm bells ring in epic loss to Kansas.”</a></p><p>“The loss to the Jayhawks, long considered the worst power five program in college football, was the ultimate embarrassment,” Breitman wrote. “There is no other way to characterize Rutgers football right now other than being in full crisis mode. That’s not being an alarmist, that’s being a realist. ...</p><p>“<span>The team looked uninspired in a hugely important game in their season and didn’t show much fight in a second half with the issue still in doubt. Where is the fire, the swagger, the pride? I’ll repeat, all of these things happened against the program formerly considered the worst of all the power five teams.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p>“This team has a chance to dispose of that title in three weeks when they play Illinois, but that’s the reality we are in my friends. The perception of Rutgers football nationally and within the Big Ten is that it’s a joke and they proved it by losing by six touchdowns to Kansas. They didn’t cover the spread of the Ohio State game ... against Kansas. ...</p><p>“The bottom line is the product on the field is horrendous right now and at the end of the day, it comes down to coaching. You can make the talent disparity argument in getting blown out to Ohio State. There isn’t a significant disparity between Rutgers and Kansas. Certainly not six touchdowns worth.“</p><p>And finally, the Washington Post chimed in ... sort of. Jacob Bogage wrote a piece with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/09/15/only-rutgers-could-make-kansas-look-this-good-p-s-kansas-is-still-bad/?utm_term=.cf0d50fbad57\" target=\"_blank\">“Only Rutgers could make Kansas look this good. (P.S. Kansas is still bad.)“</a><br/><br/></p><p>Bogage, whose bio notes he graduated from Mizzou, wrote: “<span>Kansas and Rutgers both have very bad football programs. Saturday, they played to decide which one is worse.</span></p><p data-elm-loc=\"2\">“The answer was resounding: Congrats, Rutgers.”</p><p data-elm-loc=\"2\">There were five video clips of ugly plays from the game.</p><p data-elm-loc=\"2\">Bogage later wrote: “Kansas won the game, which makes it slightly less dumb than Rutgers. The win also marks the first time Kansas has won back-to-back Football Bowl Subdivision games since 2009. Good for you, Kansas.”</p></div>",

              "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>After a quiet preseason and season-opener, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Sammy Watkins turned in a 100-yard receiving performance against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Week 2 win. </p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Sammy Watkins ran from right to left, darting behind quarterback Patrick Mahomes in time to grab the handoff on a jet sweep. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">He turned the corner, splitting a pair of Pittsburgh defenders and darted up the field. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Steelers dived at Watkins, grasping at his feet. Another tried to grab him from the side, but Watkins extended his arm and shoved him out of the way. Finally, Vince Williams wrapped Watkins up, but the wide receiver still fought for a few extra yards, dipping his shoulder and pushing forward until he was finally brought down seven yards from the goal line. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Watkins, of course, is a receiver by trade, but that 31-yard run in the first quarter of the Chiefs’ 42-37 win at Pittsburgh ultimately settled him down and helped him churn out his best performance since coming to Kansas City.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Kind of felt like a running back,” he said Sunday. “It felt good. It got me going early on. Got tackled and after that, it was kind of like, ‘OK, I’m here.’ Got all the butterflies out.” </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Prior to that long run, Watkins had three catches for 67 yards. By the end of the game, he had seven catches for 100 yards, averaging 16.7 yards per catch. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Though he wasn’t on the receiving end of one of Mahomes’ six touchdown throws, Watkins’ involvement in the offense was somewhat of a welcome relief after a quiet preseason and season-opener. As a new addition to the Chiefs in the offseason, Watkins has immersed himself in the complexities Andy Reid’s playbook. The payoff has been a slow build. But Sunday in Pittsburgh was a sign of positive progress. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Not only did Watkins catch six of seven targets, the lone incompletion coming as Mahomes overthrew him in the end zone early in the third quarter, but he also showed his strength as he broke tackles and ran through contact. Through two weeks, Watkins has 54 yards after catch, averaging six per reception. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I think Sammy Watkins showed everybody some stuff and opened some eyes today to show that he is the real deal,” tight end Travis Kelce said. “He’s going to be one heck of a weapon for us this year.” </p><p dir=\"ltr\">A week earlier against the Chargers, Watkins had three catches on five targets for just 21 yards — a far cry from his earlier days in Buffalo when he infamously demanded to have 10 targets a game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">But Watkins is in a new system now and his mentality has evolved. He’s playing with an array of offensive threats, and he’s OK being selfless.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I’m not going to have 100 yards every game,” Watkins said. “That’s not realistic. But to be out there playing hard, playing physical, blocking. I think that’s what it’s about. It’s not about who got the stats and stuff like that. If I’m playing hard, playing fast and we’re getting wins, that’s what it’s about.” </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Everyone got involved in the offense in Sunday’s win, reflecting what Reid and his players preached throughout training camp and the preseason. It also looked entirely different from what Reid schemed up for Week 1, where most everything flowed through speedy wide receiver Tyreek Hill. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">This time, the emphasis seemed to shift to tight end Travis Kelce and Watkins from the very beginning. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kelce was targeted once on the first drive and caught the touchdown the second. Watkins had back-to-back catches in the second drive, including one that went for 40 yards. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I’m happy for Sammy,” Reid said. “Sammy has gone through a few things through his career, and he comes here as one of the big names, he saw what he is. You get that ball in his hand, and he’s an explosive runner. It’s like you have a running back when he has that ball, big, strong and physical. So, I need to do a better job of making sure we get it to him. Travis Kelce, too, he had a nice game today. A lot of positives.” </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Even with a solid performance, Watkins knows he still has more learning to do. He’s catching on to Reid’s schemes, but he’s not there yet.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“There’s no rush,” Watkins said. “It’s the second game. The coaches are just going to continue to put me in the right positions. I’m going to continue to grow with this offense and today just shows how well we can play together if we continue to work together.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\"> <!-- %asset:217344700% --> </p></div>",

That happens a lot, “everywhere,” said one girl in the video.</p><p>“It upsets me that students would take something that some people value and want, and make it somehow a joke or a punishment to that person, singling them out, especially when it’s someone who doesn’t realize that it’s a joke, and that is just cruel,” a female teacher said in the video.</p><p>Sophomore student council member Maddie Dunlap told MLive that while much of the response to the change has been positive, not everyone is happy. Girls who hoped to be homecoming queen are disappointed, she said.</p><p>The court of public opinion is divided as well.</p><div class=\"_5pbx userContent _3576\"><p>“<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/detroitfreepress/posts/10156882869310530?__xts__[0]=68.ARCqOiQgb3euYfFjktebuWcTvGQbxz4f82QV12pREetMrwp_nPPXC3QxW0QtGF_33iAckoKn957a5K7oQYCOAXjDJgPykudSa07HS68Fu16ldhnezeNPDzn3-bzhFdIAa_mCBkyiv78mYJiuegLg6KqMIzcFbJKLQET4ZobwSTWIAYEqSRkVl9A&amp;__tn__=-R\" target=\"_blank\">They should keep the tradition of crowning homecoming queens</a> and have another ceremony for those receiving awards for excellence.

    "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n            <p>Johnson County will accept nearly 1,500 provisional ballots either in full or in part, but there is confusion about the status of some unaffiliated voters. </p>\n          </div>",
    "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Small numbers of ballots in Johnson and Sedgwick counties are at the center of dispute between the backers of Gov. Jeff Colyer and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach in a primary race that may eventually be settled in court.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kansas law allows unaffiliated voters to declare their party on Election Day and vote in the primary, but the supporters of the two Republican rivals disagree whether this law puts the burden on voters or poll workers to ensure the paperwork is properly completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">And the state’s two largest counties <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216489915.html\">don’t appear to be handling the issue uniformly.</a></p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker, the deputy whom Kobach has tapped to oversee vote counting in the historically close election, said in a news release Sunday night that “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216584870.html\">Rucker issued his release less than 12 hours</a> before the bulk of the state’s counties, including its two most populous, were set to begin canvassing, a process that will determine whether <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216446680.html\">thousands of provisional ballots count</a> in a race where a few hundred votes separate the candidates. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Brant Laue, Colyer’s chief counsel, argued in a letter Monday morning that Kansas law requires counties to accept ballots from unaffiliated voters regardless of whether the registration switch was completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Laue said on letterhead from the governor’s office.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Both Johnson and<a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\"> Sedgwick counties </a>voted to accept thousands of provisional ballots Monday, but a handful of ballots in each of the counties could be at the center of litigation if the primary fails to yield a clear winner after canvassing is completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach saw his lead on Colyer grow to 206 votes by 5 p.m. as more than 60 smaller counties processed their provisional ballots. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sedgwick and Johnson counties, which account for more than 40 percent of the state’s provisional ballots, will certify their new vote totals Tuesday.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Rucker <a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\">called Sedgwick County to complain</a> immediately after the county’s canvassing board voted to approve 14 ballots where an unaffiliated voter failed to check the box for party label. He argued with the county’s lawyer about the legality of their inclusion in the vote tally. </p>\n            <h3>Confusion in JoCo</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">In Johnson County, Colyer’s campaign staff left a canvassing meeting thinking that the state’s most populous county would be counting all unaffiliated voters who cast ballots in governor primary.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">But it appears that Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker misspoke on the issue, leading to confusion about which ballots will be counted when Johnson County does its final tally on Tuesday.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Metsker referred to questions about the status of unaffiliated voters who were wrongly told to cast provisional ballots at their polling places and said votes would be counted for 57 unaffiliated voters in Johnson County who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">After the meeting, The Star asked Metsker specifically whether this meant that voters who were told to cast provisional ballots instead of declaring a party would see their votes counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“That’s correct. We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Clay Barker, Colyer’s special assistant, took Metsker’s assurances as a sign that the county was not following Rucker’s guidance.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“It would appear to me that the county commissioners, with counsel from their elections commissioner and legal counsel, decided to ignore it and do what they’ve done in the past, which is count ballots because they show a poll worker’s mistake,” said Barker, an attorney who previously served as executive director of the Kansas Republican Party.</p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216595325% -->\n            </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The Johnson County Board of Canvassers voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 provisional ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations. The 57 ballots from unaffiliated voters that declared parties are part of that total.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">But the board also voted unanimously to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons, including 35 ballots for which a voter failed to declare a party.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach’s spokeswoman, Danedri Herbert, contacted The Star shortly after the meeting to emphasize the distinction.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“I just think it’s important to understand the difference because other counties are now trying to follow Johnson County’s lead,” Herbert said.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Ed Eilert, who chairs the canvassing board and the Johnson County Commission, said he thought the distinction between which unaffiliated voters would count and which would not was clear at the meeting.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Regarding the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t count, Eilert said, most were mail-in ballots, according to his notes.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“There’s a place on there if you’re unaffiliated to mark the party and they didn’t,” Eilert said. “That’s the difference between the two.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The canvassing board, which is made up by the county’s commissioners, also voted to accept 275 ballots in part. Most of these ballots are from people who went to the wrong polling place on Election Day. Their votes for all statewide races, such as the primary for governor, will count.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"> Colyer’s campaign referred to Laue’s letter when asked about the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t be counted.</p>\n            <h3>More scrutiny in Sedgwick County</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The issue of unaffiliated voters received more scrutiny in Sedgwick County.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sedgwick County Commissioner David Dennis said it would have been easy for voters to miss what he called the “tiny box” on the form.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">And Sedgwick County Commissioner Jim Howell said the voters would have had to tell election workers which party they wanted to join to obtain a ballot. He also said he thinks the election officials at the polls should have checked that the form was completed before giving a ballot to the voter. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Tabitha Lehman, the county’s election commissioner, remained neutral on the issue of whether the votes should be counted. But she did say she trains poll workers not to advise voters on how to fill out the forms because she doesn’t want them to be seen as encouraging voters to affiliate with one party or another.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The confusion for voters was scorned by Cille King, a co-president for the League of Women Voters of Kansas. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">If poll workers instructed the voter wrong, “I don’t think the voter should be penalized,” King said.</p>\n            <h3>Other counties</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">In 11 other Kansas counties surveyed by The Star that sorted through provisional and mail-in votes Monday, there was no question that previously unaffiliated voters’ ballots would be counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Rick Piepho, the county clerk and election officer of Harvey County, said unaffiliated voters should declare a party simply by going through the provisional ballot process.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“On the provisional envelope — at least on ours — there’s a box on there that says I’m declaring such-and-such ... party and we have them declare on there, so when they’re signing the provisional envelope they’re also signing that declaration,” Piepho said. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Most poll workers in these smaller counties asked unaffiliated voters to fill out a voter affiliation card or a voter registration card to declare their party, and they were given a standard ballot to vote in that party’s primary, clerks said. A few voters were asked to vote provisionally, which clerks attributed to poll worker error, but those votes were counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“They had to fill out a card in order to be able to get a ballot,” McPherson County Clerk Hollie Melroy said.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sonya Stohs, county clerk in Marshall County, said 18 unaffiliated voters at two polling places in her county were asked to fill out provisional ballots because of poll worker error, but they all counted. </p>\n            <h3>Postmarks and other issues</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Among the 898 votes thrown out Monday in Johnson County were four mail-in ballots that lacked a postmark or had an illegible postmark.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach’s office advised counties that these types of ballots could not be counted last week, which prompted Colyer to call on the state’s chief election official to recuse himself from the process.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Votes won’t count for an additional 59 people who did not provide photo ID as required by Kansas law. And 272 people registered in one party tried to vote in the other party’s primary.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">One voter died after casting a ballot, which prompted the election office to recommend the vote be treated as invalid.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“We only had one of those, thank God,” Metsker told the commissioners.</p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216341105% -->\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216340375% -->\n            </p>\n          </div>",

            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Kansas’ two biggest counties made different decisions on how to count some ballots from last week’s election, meaning that some Sedgwick County voters who messed up on a form will have their votes count, while Johnson County voters who did the same thing won’t.</p><p>The conflict only affects 49 ballots out of more 200,000 cast statewide. In an ordinary election year it probably would have gone unnoticed. </p><p>But this time, those could be critical votes with Secretary of State Kris Kobach leading Gov. Jeff Colyer in the Republican race for governor by only 206 votes at the end of the business day Monday. </p><p>At issue are disputed provisional ballots, which were cast by voters who tried to switch from no-party status to affiliating with a party so they could vote in the primary on election day.</p><p>State law allows that last-minute switch, but there is a form for that and some voters didn’t fill out the form correctly.</p><p>Sedgwick County officials voted Monday to give those voters the benefit of the doubt; Johnson County officials voted to toss the ballots out.</p><p>Those decisions affect 14 Sedgwick County votes and 35 Johnson County votes.</p><p>Overall, Sedgwick County’s election board voted to count 1,326 provisional and disputed ballots, adding them to the total votes from the Aug. 7 primary election. </p><p>The results will be announced Tuesday morning.<br/><br/></p><p>The most disputed were 14 ballots cast at the polls by unaffiliated voters who indicated they wished to declare a party and vote in the primary, but who failed to check a box indicating the party of their choice on the form.</p><p>The election board voted 4-1 to count those votes.</p><p>The board is by law made up of the members of the Sedgwick County Commission. On Monday, one commissioner, Richard Ranzau, couldn’t be there, so his seat was taken by Karen Bailey, the chief deputy county clerk who was appointed as substitute. </p><p>Bailey was the only “no” vote on counting the 14 disputed ballots.</p><p>Commissioner David Dennis said it would have been easy for voters to miss what he called the “tiny box” on the form.</p><p>And Commissioner Jim Howell said the voters would have had to tell election workers which party they wanted to join to obtain a ballot. He also said he thinks the election officials at the polls should have checked that the form was completed before giving a ballot to the voter. </p><p>Election Commissioner Tabitha Lehman remained neutral on the issue of whether the votes should be counted. But she did say she trains poll workers not to advise voters on how to fill out the forms because she doesn’t want them to be seen as encouraging voters to affiliate themselves with one party or another.</p><p>The decisions of which votes to count were part of canvassing the vote, a process that is usually ministerial and noncontroversial. But it’s been magnified this election because of the whisker-thin margin in the race for the Republican nomination for governor.</p><p>Immediately after the decision to count the 14 disputed ballots, Kobach’s assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker called to object, arguing over the legality of the decision with Sedgwick County Counselor Eric Yost.<br/><br/></p><p>Under pressure from Colyer and his campaign team, Kobach has recused himself from overseeing the election.

We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied. “These are citizens. We train them. We train them hard. There were a number of problems at that location.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216610415% --></p><p>However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party.</p><p>“This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.”</p><p>But that doesn’t include the 35 other provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who did not mark a form to declare a party. Those votes will be disallowed.</p><p>The Johnson County election board voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations.</p><p>The board also voted to accept 275 ballots in part and to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons. </p><p>The Johnson County board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.<br/><br/></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"436\" style=\"width: 327pt;\"> <colgroup><col width=\"368\"

Jeff Colyer’s office as the feud between the two Republican candidates continues. </p><p>As county canvassing boards began to meet Monday to review provisional votes, Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker said in an email late Sunday that “there has been considerable public discussion regarding whether unaffiliated voters can participate in Kansas party primary elections.”</p><p>He then attached a series of legal instructions including that “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p><p>Under Kansas law, unaffiliated voters are able to declare a party at the polls, and then vote in that party’s primary. Kansas law does not allow for open Republican and Democratic primaries.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign late last week voiced concerns about unaffiliated voters who were incorrectly told by poll workers to cast provisional ballots.</p><p>The governor’s office argued in a legal opinion sent to The Star Monday morning that “Kansas law requires canvassers to look to the intent of the voter” in cases where a poll worker incorrectly tells an unaffiliated voter to cast a provisional ballot, rather than to affiliate and then vote.</p><p>“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Brant Laue, the chief legal counsel of the governor’s office, said in the letter.</p><p>Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, has a <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article216487350.html\" target=\"_self\">slim lead, 110 votes, over Colyer in the GOP primary for governor</a>. Roughly 9,000 provisional ballots are spread across the state’s 105 counties. More than 40 percent of those ballots come from Johnson and Sedgwick counties, where Kobach has appointed the top election officials.</p><p>After initially resisting calls that he recuse himself from duties overseeing the election, Kobach eventually recused himself last week and named Rucker.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign also has alleged that “many Colyer voters had difficulties finding his name on the ballot, were forced to vote on provisional ballots, or were turned away outright for unknown reasons.”<br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:216521210% --></p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Gov. Jeff Colyer’s campaign staff left Monday morning’s canvassing meeting in Johnson County with the belief that the state’s most populous county would be counting all unaffiliated voters who cast ballots in the primary for governor. </p><p>But it appears that Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker misspoke on the issue Monday morning, leading to confusion for the Colyer campaign and others about which ballots will be counted when Johnson County does its final vote tally Tuesday. </p><p>Metsker referred to questions about the status of unaffiliated voters who were wrongly told to cast provisional ballots at their polling places and said 57 unaffiliated voters in Johnson County who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots would have their votes counted. </p><p>After the meeting, The Star asked Metsker specifically whether this meant that voters who were told to cast provisional ballots instead of declaring a party would see their votes counted. </p><p>“That’s correct. We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied. “These are citizens. We train them. We train them hard. There were a number of problems at that location.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216610415% --> </p><p>However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party. </p><p> “This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.” </p><p>The distinction affects 35 other ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who did not declare a party and won’t have their ballots counted.</p><p>The Johnson County Board of Canvassers voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations. </p><p> The canvassing board, which is made up by the county’s commissioners, also voted to accept 275 ballots in part and to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons. The majority of voters who will only have their ballots partially counted went to the wrong polling place on Election Day. Their votes for all statewide races, such as the primary for governor, will count.</p><p>The board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign raised concerns last week that unaffiliated voters who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots would not have their votes counted.</p><p>Kansas law allows unaffiliated voters to declare a party on the day of the primary to vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary.</p><p>Assistant Kansas Secretary of State Eric Rucker issued a guidance late Sunday night saying that if “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p><p>Clay Barker, Colyer’s special assistant, took Metsker’s assurances at the Monday meeting as a sign that the county was not following Rucker’s guidance. </p><p>“It would appear to me that the county commissioners with counsel from their elections commissioner and legal counsel decided to ignore it and do what they’ve done in the past, which is count ballots because they show a poll worker’s mistake,” said Barker, an attorney who previously served as executive director of the Kansas Republican Party.</p><p>Kobach’s spokeswoman, Danedri Herbert, contacted The Star shortly after the meeting to dispute that all of these ballots were being accepted. </p><p>“I just think it’s important to understand the difference, because other counties are now trying to follow Johnson County’s lead,” Herbert said. </p><p>Ed Eilert, who chairs the canvassing board and the county commission, said that he believes the distinction between which unaffiliated voters would count and which would not was clear at the meeting. </p><p>Regarding the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t count Eilert said that those are mostly mail-in ballots, according to his notes. </p><p>“There’s a place on there if you’re unaffiliated to mark the party and they didn’t,” Eilert said. “That’s the difference between the two.” </p><p>The issue also came up during Sedgwick County’s canvassing meeting. That county’s canvassing board voted<a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\" target=\"_blank\"> to accept 14 ballots cast by unaffiliated voters </a>who did not check a box marking party affiliation. </p><p>Rucker called Sedgwick County to object about the inclusion of the ballots immediately after the county’s vote, arguing about their legality with Sedgwick County Counselor Eric Yost. </p><p>The dispute could wind up in court. </p><p>Brant Laue, Colyer’s chief counsel, argued in a letter Monday morning that Kansas law requires counties to accept ballots from unaffiliated voters regardless of whether the registration switch was completed. Colyer’s campaign pointed back to this letter when asked for a comment about the confusion in Johnson County. </p><p>“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Laue said in a letter on letterhead from the governor’s office.</p><p>The confusion for voters was scorned by Cille King, a co-president for the League of Women Voters of Kansas. </p><p>If poll workers instructed the voter wrong, “I don’t think the voter should be penalized,” King said.</p><p>Among the 898 votes that were thrown out Monday in Johnson County were four mail-in ballots that lacked a postmark or had an illegible postmark.</p><p>Kobach’s office advised counties that these types of ballots couldnot be counted last week, which prompted Colyer to call on the state’s chiefelection official to recuse himself from the process.</p><p>An additional 59 people will not have their votes counted because they did notprovide photo ID as required by Kansas law. And 272 people tried to vote in theother party’s primary. </p><p>One voter died after casting a ballot, which prompted the election office to recommend the vote be treated as invalid.</p><p>“We only had one of those. Thank God,” Metsker told the commissioners.</p><p><!-- %asset:216341105% --> </p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

            "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Kansas Democrats don’t yet know which Republican they’ll face in the general election for governor. They says that’s a good thing.</p></div>",
            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kansas Democrats are delighted by the continuing battle between Kris Kobach and Jeff Colyer in the Republican race for governor. The prolonged uncertainty over who will win the primary election effectively hands Democrats “buckets of free money,” they say.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Republican race for governor may remain undecided for weeks and potentially end in lawsuits. Democrats say the extended drama gives them a head start on fundraising and organizing going into the general election season.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“It’s as if the Republicans are handing us buckets and buckets of free money … it’s days their money isn’t being used to attack anybody,” said Chris Reeves, a Democratic national committeeman in Kansas.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans are downplaying the possibility the unresolved contest between Kobach and Colyer, the current governor, will ultimately harm them in November. But they acknowledge the standoff could slow fundraising on their side.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kansas Republican Party Chairman Kelly Arnold said the uncertainty about the nominee “makes it a little more difficult for the campaigns to raise money … until they know they’re the candidate.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“You’ve got a number of people … who kind of wait until after the primaries are over because they’re there to support our nominee,” Arnold said. “Many of them are still sitting on the sidelines waiting.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">On Friday, Kobach, the secretary of state, held a lead of 110 votes, according to his office. The margin will almost certainly change when county election officials begin sifting through provisional ballots Monday.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The final results may not be certified until Aug. 31. Recounts and litigation remain possible.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">“We want the Republicans to spend as much time as they need to while we’re out talking to voters about what the future looks like,” Kansas House Minority Leader Jim Ward, a Wichita Democrat, said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">State Sen. Laura Kelly easily won the Democratic nomination for governor on election night and transitioned into general election mode. She has said it doesn’t matter whether she ends up facing Colyer or Kobach.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“The longer the story is indecision, confusion, disunity on the Republican side, I think the better that is for Democrats,” said Ethan Corson, director of the Kansas Democratic Party.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans, on the other hand, are waiting for the vote counting process to finish.</p><p>Arnold called the unresolved race a “temporary obstacle” that the party will work around and said the situation won’t hurt Republicans.<br/><br/></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He said Republicans will begin attacking Kelly right away.<br/><br/></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“We kind of have campaign plan A and campaign plan A.1 depending on which candidate we have,” Arnold said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Political parties typically use the days following a primary to unite and mend relationships frayed during the primary campaign. Parties and campaigns also intensify outreach to donors and activists as they kick off the general election season.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But instead of unifying, tensions are rising between Kobach and Colyer, who became governor six months ago when Sam Brownback resigned.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Colyer on Thursday demanded Kobach recuse himself from providing advice to county election officers and said he had made statements on national TV that were inconsistent with Kansas law. Colyer also hinted at the possibility of litigation.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kobach said Friday afternoon in a letter to Colyer that he would recuse himself from overseeing vote counting but said the decision is symbolic because the counties count votes, not him. He named longtime deputy Eric Rucker to oversee the election in his stead, but the Colyer campaign said his appointment didn’t address their concerns about a conflict of interest.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kobach also said Colyer’s rhetoric risked undermining public confidence in the election process.</p><p><!-- %asset:216335185% --> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">An extended recount or legal process could damage Republicans if candidates become hostile toward each other, said Patrick Miller, a political scientist at the University of Kansas.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“That would cost them time and resources and any of that hostility that gets out in the media doesn’t help the eventual nominee. It doesn’t help heal the wounds that always occur with primaries,” Miller said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Given that Republican voters were sharply divided between Kobach and Colyer, Senate Vice President Jeff Longbine, an Emporia Republican, said Republicans must analyze the results to determine exactly what voters said and carry out a strategy based on that message.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“I think it’s extremely important at this point for the Republican Party to make sure that we are inclusive, that we are listening to everyone’s thoughts and ideas within the party and that we get that unification that we’re going to need to be successful in November,” Longbine said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite the current division, Miller said Republicans still have a built-in structural advantage over Democrats: independent Greg Orman. Miller predicts Orman will draw away Democratic voters.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orman, a Johnson County businessman, isn’t officially on the general election ballot yet. He turned in thousands of signatures Monday to secure a spot and is waiting on the secretary of state’s office to certify the signatures.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“(Republicans) can afford to have damaging events occur, or to nominate someone like Kobach who appears from the polling to be a weaker candidate than Colyer,” Miller said. “They can afford that because they have the opposition split.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orman has rejected the argument that he will only take votes from Democrats. He has said he will build a coalition of Democrats as well as Republicans and independents.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Asked Friday whether the current lack of a Republican nominee helps Orman, campaign spokesman Sam Edelen said that regardless of who the nominee is, “the choice voters will have in November will be clear”: between two career politicians or Orman, a businessman.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans say they’re ready to move on to the general election.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">At a GOP unity breakfast on Wednesday, House Majority Leader Don Hineman, R-Dighton, called on Republicans in all political races to come together.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“What we need to remember is what happened yesterday was an intramural scrimmage,” Hineman said. “What’s coming up is a varsity match.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Missouri is 3-0 after a last-second win over Purdue but the Tigers go into Saturday’s game against No. 2 Georgia with a lot of problems to fix, mainly on defense. The last time Georgia visited, Missouri blew a late lead and lost on a fourth-down play. A win would propel Drew Lock’s Heisman status, and likely get the Tigers ranked and start contract extension talks for Barry Odom. </p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">The details</h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Kickoff:</b> 11 a.m. Saturday</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Where:</b> Memorial Stadium, Columbia</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>TV:</b> ESPN</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Radio:</b> KMBZ (98.1 FM)</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>The line:</b> Georgia by 16 1/2</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><!-- %asset:217586570% --></p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Five things to know</h3><ol><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Missouri’s offense</b> matched up well against Georgia last season: The Tigers’ 28 points against the Bulldogs were the second-most a team scored on them in the regular season and third most behind Oklahoma and Auburn. While Missouri lost 53-28 in Athens last year, the game was close in the first half.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>And you thought</b> Missouri’s D-line was struggling? Georgia ranks dead last among FBS teams in sacks, with just one. Missouri’s offensive line has done a good job protecting Drew Lock through three games, that should continue.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>This is an interesting game for </b>Derek Dooley: He got his start in coaching as a defensive graduate assistant at Georgia, when coach Kirby Smart was still a player. They go way back. And Dooley’s son J.T. is a walk-on receiver for the Bulldogs. Will Smart put him in the game if the score dictates it?</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>The Tigers’ secondary</b> is a mess: Missouri ranks No. 118 in passing defense. Cornerback DeMarkus Acy went out after the first play at Purdue because of “somewhat of a concussion,” Odom said, and his status for Saturday is unknown. The Tigers missed Acy greatly and can’t afford a repeat performance.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>The stadium should be</b> electric: Missouri AD Jim Sterk told reporters that the Georgia game was close to a sellout before the Purdue game went final. Memorial Stadium should be sold out by Saturday for the first time since the 2014 season finale against Arkansas.</p></li></ol><p dir=\"ltr\"><!-- %asset:217344820% --></p></div>",

We’re about to find out. </p><p>This will not be an easy opener. The Wildcats (2-1) head to Morgantown as 14 1/2-point underdogs against the No. 12 Mountaineers (2-0). But <a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/sports/college/big-12/kansas-state/article218407150.html\" target=\"_blank\">they did get a confidence boost over the weekend from a 41-17 victory over Texas-San Antonio</a>, while West Virginia players sat at home following the cancellation of their game against North Carolina State because of Hurricane Florence.</p><h3 style=\"font-size: 1.71429em;\">The details</h3><p><b>Kickoff:</b> 2:30 p.m. Saturday</p><p><b>Where:</b> Milan Puskar Stadium, Morgantown, W.Va.</p><p><b>TV:</b> ESPN</p><p><b>Radio:</b> KQAM (1480 AM) in Wichita, KCSP (610 AM) in Kansas City</p><p><b>The line:</b> West Virginia by 14 1/2</p><p><!-- %asset:217586570% --></p><h3 style=\"font-size: 1.71429em;\">Five things to know</h3><ol><li><b>The Mountaineers have one of the nation’s most explosive offenses.</b> With Heisman Trophy contender Will Grier at quarterback and dynamic playmakers Gary Jennings and David Sills at receiver, it’s difficult for any defense to slow this passing attack. West Virginia flexed its offensive muscles in its first two games, routing Tennessee 40-14 and Youngstown State 52-17. WVU is averaging 586 yards per game.</li><li><b>This is Dana Holgorsen’s most complete team</b> of his eight-year tenure with the Mountaineers. Not only is this West Virginia group loaded on offense, it is also playing solid defense, allowing 297 yards per game. </li><li><b>West Virginia has had K-State’s number in recent years.</b> K-State won its first five games against West Virginia when the Mountaineers joined the Big 12 in 2012, but the Wildcats haven’t had any luck the past two years. West Virginia won both, including 28-23 last year in Manhattan. </li><li><b>This could be K-State’s most difficult game of the season.</b> The Wildcats have already played No. 14 Mississippi State and must later take on No. 5 Oklahoma, but West Virginia could be every bit as challenging. The Mountaineers 3-4 defense and high-flying offense are always difficult to prepare for.</li><li><b>K-State may be short handed again on defense. </b>Starting safety Denzel Goolsby isn’t expected to return from injury anytime soon. Defensive back Kevion McGee has missed two straight games because of an injury. And Linebacker Elijah Sullivan remains questionable after missing the UTSA game. The Wildcats will need players like Eli Walker and Sam Sivelove to step up on defense against a formidable opponent.</li></ol></div>",

He’s the first quarterback to throw for 10 touchdown passes in his first three NFL games, and he didn’t throw one in his debut in the 2017 regular-season finale at Denver. And talk about an equal-opportunity offense: Mahomes’ TD passes this season have gone to eight different players.</p><h3>Teams are special</h3><p>The first two games have started in special ways for the Chiefs, who won the coin toss against the Chargers and Steelers, deferred to the second half, and forced a three and out and punt on the opening possession. Tyreek Hill returned the kick against the Chargers 91 yards for a touchdown, and De’Anthony Thomas returned his 48 yards to set up a short-field score against the Steelers. No one’s postgame smile in the first two weeks has been bigger than special teams coach Dave Toub.</p><h3>Sack opportunity?</h3><p>The Chiefs got one against the Steelers when Allen Bailey got his arms around Ben Roelisthberger. That’s a week after Dee Ford got the team’s lone sack against the Chargers. Could this week be the game the defense steps up in a bigger way? In the 49ers’ 30-27 victory over the Lions on Sunday, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was sacked six times and has been taken down nine times this season.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217344615% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Three high-profile commitments with two months to go until the November signing period is a pretty good spot for John Calipari to be in, and his early recruiting haul received more accolades last week with Rivals.com’s latest update to its <a href=\"https://n.rivals.com/prospect_rankings/rivals150/2019\">class of 2019 rankings</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The biggest mover among players ranked in the top 20 was <a href=\"https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2019/kahlil-whitney-171026\">Kahlil Whitney</a>, who committed to Kentucky last month and jumped from No. 23 to No. 7 on Rivals’ list.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The only other committed player in the new top 10 was <a href=\"https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2019/tyrese-maxey-171839\">Tyrese Maxey</a>, the affable point guard from Texas who committed to the Cats back in May and is the No. 9 player in the country.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And the highest-ranked high school player from Kentucky? That would be Pendleton County’s <a href=\"https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2019/dontaie-allen-225600\">Dontaie Allen</a>, who picked UK in early August and is ranked No. 54 nationally by Rivals.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“It’s the start of what you expect from John Calipari and Kentucky in recruiting,” Rivals.com national analyst Eric Bossi told the Herald-Leader. “They’re off to a great start.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Bossi added that he expects Kentucky to land “two or three more big-time guys” in the 2019 cycle and contend for the honor of No. 1 recruiting class in the country yet again. Calipari visited five of the six top-ranked prospects in the new Rivals rankings — Vernon Carey, James Wiseman, Jaden McDaniels, Isaiah Stewart and Matthew Hurt — <a href=\"https://www.kentucky.com/sports/college/kentucky-sports/uk-recruiting/article218514525.html\">over the past week alone</a>, and several other highly touted players remain on his 2019 wish list.</p><p> <!-- %asset:218348885% --> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Cats’ recruiting haul so far is <a href=\"https://basketballrecruiting.rivals.com/news/rivals-rankings-week-five-programs-that-should-be-pleased-2\">good enough for the No. 2 national ranking</a> — behind Southern Cal — and it’s a group led by Whitney, an athletic wing player from Chicago who was measured at 6-7.5 with a 6-10.5 wingspan at last month’s Nike Skills Academy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Such drastic moves — from No. 23 to No. 7 — are not often seen within the five-star ranking zone, but Whitney has had an especially impressive year so far.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I don’t think anyone has ever disputed how talented he was. But he hasn’t always been in the situation to be the man,” Bossi said. “This spring and summer was really the first time where he was clear cut with the opportunity to be the man, and we really liked what we saw from him in the spring. We toyed with maybe moving him into the top 15 after the spring, but we just kind of wanted that one more summer of, ‘OK, let’s watch and be sure that this is really what we think of him.’ And he was even better during July.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“A lot of kids talk about getting serious in the gym and putting in the time and committing to their craft, but you can see once they hit the floor who is really about that life and who isn’t. And Kahlil has clearly been about that. His jump shot is much improved. His ball handling is much improved. A consistent motor and effort and trying to step on people’s throats — that’s him now. And that hasn’t always been the case.”</p><p>Whitney, who plays for Roselle Catholic (N.J.), the alma mater of former UK player Isaiah Briscoe, has acknowledged past issues with not sustaining his energy on the court. He showed over the summer that motor is no longer a problem, and analysts have taken notice.<a href=\"https://247sports.com/Season/2019-Basketball/RecruitRankings/?InstitutionGroup=HighSchool\"> 247Sports ranks him No. 6 nationally</a>, and<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/playerrankings/_/view/espnu100/sort/rank/class/2019\"> ESPN has him at No. 9</a>.<br/><br/></p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I think he has to be looked at as a legitimate one-and-done candidate at this point,” Bossi said. “What happens in college and over the next year of high school will obviously play into that. He’s reached this point. Now he can’t settle and feel like he’s made it. He probably needs to work even harder than he’s worked to get to where he is. But that potential is certainly there, and he does look to me now like a guy who isn’t just going to be a good college player. He’s going to be a guy who can come in and make an immediate and big impact right away as a freshman.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Maxey and Allen are obviously important additions, too, and Rivals.com national analyst Corey Evans says the versatility of this initial trio should give Kentucky several options — both on the court and in the way the Cats finish out the 2019 recruiting cycle. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“They have the top in-state prospect — and one of the best isolation scorers on the wing — with Dontaie Allen,” Evans told the Herald-Leader. “They have maybe the biggest alpha dog of them all with Kahlil Whitney. And they have the biggest personality with Tyrese Maxey. So it’s not a bland class whatsoever. It checks a lot of the boxes when it comes to energy, scoring, shooting, defense, toughness.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I think it just gives Calipari and his staff a lot of wiggle room going into the fall, as far as what they need or what they want. Because guys like Maxey and Whitney, they can mask so many other holes that might be there.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:212444894% --> </p><p> <!-- %asset:215716970% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ amazing start to the season — 10 touchdowns, no interceptions — has helped the Chiefs to a pair of big road wins over the Chargers and Steelers.</p><p>It’s got Chiefs fans buzzing, and here’s the thing, members of the national media are also gushing over Mahomes. The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and Yahoo Sports all had stories about Mahomes’ quick start. I’ve included a snippet of what each person wrote and you can click the link to read the full stories, although some may require a paid subscription.</p><p>Here is what people are saying.</p><p>Adam Kilgore of the Washington Post wrote a story with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/09/16/the-nfl-belongs-to-patrick-mahomes-now/?utm_term=.3adf1cd21600\">“The NFL belongs to Patrick Mahomes now.”</a></p><p>“His physical ability and phenomenal performances fail to encapsulate Mahomes’s place in the league,” Kilgore wrote. “He’s too physically gifted to be seen as a prototype — good luck finding the next mobile, 6-foot-3 quarterback who can throw it 70 yards in the air. But Mahomes — a collegiate product of the ‘Air Raid’ offense, a starting quarterback on his rookie deal, a triggerman for Andy Reid’s designs and a conductor of concepts taken from college football — is something close to an ideal of modern NFL quarterback. He fits into every way the league is leaning.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Reid’s schemes have become the model for how offense is played. Seven NFL head coaches once coached under Reid, including reigning Super Bowl winner Doug Pederson and the Chicago Bears’s Matt Nagy, whose creative play-calling would have been the talk of the league if not for Aaron Rodgers’s heroics last Sunday night in Green Bay’s comeback victory. Mahomes’s talent may have made him a star in any setting, but he landed with perhaps the best developer of quarterbacks and most influential offensive mind in the game.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kilgore concludes with this:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“And so Sunday may have only been a start for Mahomes. He will face stiffer challenges than Pittsburgh’s secondary, to be sure, and not every Sunday will feel like a glimpse into a fluorescent future of the sport. But through two weeks, Mahomes hasn’t only been the most impressive player in the league. He’s been a signpost of where the sport is headed.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Andrew Beaton of the Wall Street Journal wrote a story with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/patrick-mahomes-is-conquering-the-nfl-1537136770?mod=e2tws\">“Patrick Mahomes is conquering the NFL.”</a></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Beaton opened the piece by writing about the risk the Chiefs took in trading away Alex Smith, who had a great season, and making the unproven Mahomes the starter.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Two weeks into this season, it’s no longer reasonable to question if Mahomes is good, and it’s far more reasonable to ponder if Mahomes is great,” Beaton wrote. “That much was clear after his second consecutive monster game. He threw for six touchdowns in a 42-37 win against the Steelers—giving him 10 through the season’s first two weeks.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes, 22 years old, is now the youngest player in the Super Bowl era with a six-touchdown passing game. His 10 throwing scores are a record for the first two weeks of the season. But his eye-popping statistics, somehow, aren’t even the most jarring aspect of what he has done so far. That’s because somehow what he has done is less notable than how he has done it. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes has dazzled with heaves uncommon in the modern NFL, which has increasingly shifted toward favoring high-probability short passes over riskier and longer ones. Mahomes has taken that trend and blasted it to smithereens with the bazooka attached to the right side of his torso.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yahoo Sports’ Terez Paylor, the former Kansas City Star writer, had a column with the headline, <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/legend-patrick-mahomes-grows-chiefs-appear-found-qb-savior-013002515.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The legend of Patrick Mahomes grows as the Chiefs appear to have found their QB savior.”</a></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Paylor mentioned the Chiefs’ past troubles against the Steelers and why Sunday’s win meant that much more in Kansas City.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes has shown it all in wins against the Steelers and Chargers, including a rifle arm, moxie and the ability to throw under duress and from different platforms. The Chiefs needed every last drop of his talent to come out with the win on Sunday, as Mahomes managed to outduel (Ben) Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh’s future Hall of Famer, who completed 39 of 60 passes for 452 yards and three touchdowns.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes’ numbers already look ridiculous on the surface, but his performance is even more impressive when you consider it came against a Steelers team whose reliance on a fire zone pressure – where five defenders rush the passer and while the others (including defensive linemen) drop into coverage — has vexed the Chiefs in all of their previous five meetings under Reid.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Paylor later added: “Time after time against the Steelers, Mahomes’ ability to keep his eyes up under pressure, scan the pocket and deliver lasers from different platforms and launch points made the difference. The Steelers even became so weary of seeing Mahomes defeat their blitz packages that by the end of the game, they’d started dialing back on the blitzing in lieu of dropping more men into coverage.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Do not underestimate the importance of this. It is the ultimate show of respect, one reserved almost solely for quarterbacks like Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady, guys who can use their brains and rocket arms to destroy the zone blitzes that naturally leave defenses thin on players in actual coverages.”</p><p>Finally, it should come as no surprise that Peter Schrager, who is on “Good Morning Football” on the NFL Network, was wowed by Mahomes on Sunday:</p><p> <!-- %asset:218530770% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">A prediction: Arrowhead Stadium is going to be loud on Sunday. Really loud.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The unbeaten Chiefs will make their 2018 home debut Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers, and it will be the first home start of quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ career. Kickoff is at noon and the game is on WDAF (Ch. 4).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Having knocked off the preseason AFC West favorite Chargers and long-time nemesis Pittsburgh, both on the road, the Chiefs are likely to be fired up for the game, too.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In fact, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickMahomes5/status/1041445889510920194\">Mahomes tweeted</a> after Sunday’s win over the Steelers: “We are just getting started..! We are coming home #ChiefsKindom”</p><p>I’m providing a quick overview of the next Chiefs’ opponent early in each week, and here are five things to know about the 49ers, 1-1.</p><p> <!-- %asset:218539425% --> </p><h3>Jimmy G</h3><p>The 49ers were a preseason darling thanks to quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo’s strong finish to the 2017 season after being traded from New England to San Francisco. The Niners won their last five games and many expected they’d make the postseason behind Garoppolo.</p><p>But in the 49ers’ opener, Garoppolo threw three interceptions in a loss at Minnesota. On Sunday, San Francisco beat the Lions 30-27 but Garoppolo dodged a bullet. Nursing that three-point lead late in the game, the Lions’ Tracy Walker intercepted a pass that was returned to the San Francisco 7. Garoppolo was bailed out by a defensive holding call on the other side of the field.</p><p>Garoppolo has completed 33 of 59 passes for 467 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions this season.</p><h3>Meet Matt Breida</h3><p>San Francisco running back Matt Breida rushed for 138 yards against the Lions and broke off a 66-yard touchdown scamper that was the 49ers’ longest TD run in four seasons. A big block aided Breida:</p><p><!-- %asset:218528265% --></p><p>Breida, who is in his second season after signing as an undrafted free agent out of Georgia Southern, has 22 rushing attempts this season for 184 yards. Former Washington running back Alfred Morris has 86 yards rushing in 26 attempts.</p><h3>Red Zone troubles</h3><p>The 49ers made five trips to the red zone against the Lions but had to settle for a field goal three times. Garoppolo was sacked three times on those three drives that ended in field goals.</p><p>Against the Vikings in the opener, San Francisco got to the red zone four times. Here is what happened:</p><p>1. Morris fumbled at the 1</p><p>2. Settled for a 33-yard field goal</p><p>3. Scored a touchdown</p><p>4. Had to kick a 22-yard field goal.</p><p>So that’s nine trips to the red zone and just three touchdowns scored this season for the Niners.</p><h3>Richard Sherman</h3><p>The 49ers signed cornerback Richard Sherman this summer. He was a four-time Pro Bowler, a first-team All-Pro three times and won a Super Bowl with the Seattle Seahawks before coming to San Francisco.</p><p>Sherman made two tackles Sunday against the Lions and recovered a fumble in the 49ers’ season opener at Minnesota.</p><p>Heading into Monday night’s game, the 49ers rank 23rd in pass defense (278 yards per game) and are tied for the fourth-most touchdown passes allowed. Two of the top three are teams the Chiefs have played: Pittsburgh at No. 1 and the Chargers are tied for second with the Bills.</p><h3>A new receiver?</h3><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1041328126813458432\" target=\"_blank\">ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported</a> that the Cleveland Browns are expected to trade wide receiver Josh Gordon and hope to send him to a team in the NFC.</p><p>Gordon can’t dictate where the Browns will trade him, but he would like to go to Dallas or San Francisco, Schefter reported.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/49ers/article/John-Lynch-49ers-have-called-about-Browns-WR-13233684.php\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco Chronicle reported</a> that 49ers general manager John Lynch has contacted the Browns about Gordon.</p></div>",

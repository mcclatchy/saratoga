And then her life was no more. </p><p>Global Instagram model <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sineadmcnamara/\" target=\"_self\">Sinead McNamara</a> was found unconscious Friday on a superyacht docked in Greece, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/04/australia/sinead-mcnamara-yacht-death-intl/index.html\" target=\"_self\">CNN reports</a>. </p><p>The 20-year-old native Australian had reportedly been working as a crew member on the ship owned by Mexican mining billionaire Alberto Baillères. He was not on board, according to widespread media reports. </p><p> <!-- %asset:217898240% --> </p><p>The Mayan Queen IV was anchored off the island of Kefalonia; other crew members discovered the woman tangled in some rope off the side of the boat. She still had a pulse, but died en route to the hospital.</p><p>A coroner told CNN on Tuesday that her death was ruled a hanging.</p><p>Local Greek media site <a href=\"http://www.inkefalonia.gr/koinonia/64714-apopeira-aftoktonias-se-thalamigo-sto-argostoli\" target=\"_self\">Inkefalonia.gr </a>also reported that it was an “attempted suicide,” before she died. </p><p>According to the<a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/incidents/failed-relationship-focus-for-police-in-sinead-mcnamara-death-inquiry/news-story/ce2705668661c6437662fba9b5dd3075\" target=\"_self\"> News.com.au, </a>McNamara had recently gone through a bad breakup. </p><p>“She was upset and made comments about a relationship ending or some sort of trouble in her private life,” the source told the Aussie media outlet. </p><p>The woman’s last post was on Aug. 27, off the Greek coastline. Many sent their condolences. </p><p> <!-- %asset:217898200% --> </p><p>“R.I.P. beautiful angel,” wrote one.</p><p>Another poster couldn’t help but mention the irony: “I hope that it‘s not true, but i must say, if this girl really got suicidal, it‘s crazy but i think she just had such a perfect life, that she couldn’t take a heartbreaking end of a relationship.”</p><p>And yet another mentioned that social media love isn’t exactly the real thing. </p><p>“[F]ollowers can’t bring happiness. Please, reach out to someone if you’re ever feeling that there is no other choice. Spread the love.”</p></div>",

              "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>The 2018 Kansas City Chiefs will be exciting. They also might miss the playoffs for just the second time in six years, which is sort of the plan.</p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p class=\"p1\">The secret of the most anticipated Chiefs season in years is that this is not a Super Bowl contender, no matter <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/for-petes-sake/article217786245.html\" target=\"_blank\">what some in the national media are saying</a>.</p><p class=\"p1\">Might not even be a playoff team.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is not written to inflame or mock. This is not written simply because Eric Berry’s health remains uncertain, or the defense looked awful in the preseason. This is a sober look at a team with a first-year starting quarterback, major questions on defense and perhaps most convincingly a line of personnel moves that are subtly but consistently pointing to a more serious push beginning in 2019.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is not a hot take, in other words.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is the plan.</p><p class=\"p1\">Look at the biggest moves. Alex Smith was traded for a Kendall Fuller, a young and rising cornerback, and draft picks, the higher of which comes next year. This happened because the team wanted to build around young quarterback Patrick Mahomes, a tantalizing talent but one who so far has only torched Big 12 defenses at Texas Tech.</p><p class=\"p1\">Cornerback Marcus Peters was also traded, essentially because the organization was tired of repairing and reinforcing and worrying in his wake. Peters is young and game-changing and still cheap. You think a team that believes it’s close to a Super Bowl gives up on that?</p><p class=\"p1\">Of course not, but a team that believes it’s close to a Super Bowl will trade for that, which is why the Rams added him to one of the league’s most talented rosters.</p><p class=\"p1\">The free-agent moves were done with the future in mind, too. Sammy Watkins is just 25, and his red zone effectiveness (seven of his eight touchdowns last year were 17 yards or less) is seen as a complement to the 24-year-old Tyreek Hill (10 of his 13 career touchdown catches are 30 yards or more) to aid the development of the 22-year-old Mahomes.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217921400% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">Anthony Hitchens is just 26, a three-down linebacker the Chiefs think pairs well with Reggie Ragland inside and, more importantly, can be a pillar aside Justin Houston and Eric Berry to strengthen what football people refer to as “the culture.” That’s not a quick fix.</p><p class=\"p1\">You see the commonality here? Get younger, create stable support for a first-year starting quarterback and build a culture that will help rather than impede.</p><p class=\"p1\">The truth is the Chiefs’ defense probably had too many holes to fix all in one offseason, but certain circumstances also played against them.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Chiefs may have prioritized Bears cornerback Kyle Fuller in free agency, and if so it would have been on brand. He’s Kendall’s brother, another dependable teammate, and he would’ve strengthened a premium position.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">But after the Bears used their franchise tag on Fuller, the backup options were less enticing. Trumaine Johnson and Malcolm Butler each had varying so-called “character” questions, which would’ve been a difficult sell while talking about culture.</p><p class=\"p1\">Aaron Colvin would’ve been an upgrade, but the price — $34 million including $18 million guaranteed — was high for a player now listed as a backup on the Texans’ depth chart.</p><p class=\"p1\">So, the Chiefs spent bigger money on fewer players, with the caveat that the talent would still be in prime years in 2019 and 2020.</p><p class=\"p1\">The roster is full of “development guys,” particularly in the secondary — corners Charvarius Ward and Tremon Smith, safety Jordan Lucas and to a slightly lesser extent Armani Watts. The Chiefs will have an extra second-round pick next year, and will likely draft at least one cornerback high.</p><p class=\"p1\">If that’s the way it goes, the biggest concern going forward could be the pass rush. The Chiefs need as much as they can get from Houston as he enters his 30s, and more importantly they need some real production from a second rusher.</p><p class=\"p1\">Dee Ford is the most likely to make an impact in 2018, but he’s inconsistent, with unreliable health, can be a liability against the run, and will be a free agent after the season.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217768120% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">Rookie Breeland Speaks may be better suited inside — he played there in college, and could make an effective tandem with Chris Jones rushing in sub packages. If that’s the way it goes, the Chiefs would need some combination of retaining Ford, getting regular production from Tanoh Kpassagnoh, drafting a pass rusher high, or picking through a free agent class that could include Jadeveon Clowney.</p><p class=\"p1\">The other thing going on here is a tangible priority on the defensive front, perhaps influenced by the current Super Bowl champions.</p><p class=\"p1\">The discussion around the Eagles’ run typically centers around (Reid protege) Doug Pederson’s creativity, and that’s obviously a critical element.</p><p class=\"p1\">But the Eagles also won with a defense that ranked fourth in points, fourth in yards and second in Football Outsiders’ DVOA with a group of corners that nobody would envy. The strength of that group was up front, and with the safeties. The Chiefs could try to emulate.</p><p class=\"p1\">Either way, the Chiefs are approaching this as more than a quick fix. That may mean fewer wins in 2018. If that’s the way this goes, it won’t be a failure.</p><p class=\"p1\">It’ll be the plan.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217344510% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>This isn’t a fantasy advice column. </p><p>So if you’ve clicked on this headline hoping for some guidance on who to sit and who to start in Week 1, you won’t find it here. In fact, you should probably do the opposite of whatever I do. </p><p>Instead, this is a (hopefully) weekly peek inside my all-girls fantasy football league.</p><p>In 2017, 59.3 million people played fantasy sports in the U.S. and Canada, according to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association. The largest chunk — 71 percent — were male, leaving women to make up the remaining 29 percent. </p><p>I’m happy to say that I’m one of the 29 percent, along with the nine other women in my league. </p><p>Founded by my friend Kelsey, we’ve been doing the all-girls league for four years now.</p><p>The league, “Run the World: GRILS” — yes, girls is misspelled, no we don’t know why we haven’t fixed it over the years — is pretty low-stakes. Some years we haven’t wagered any money. This year, we’re doing a $20 buy-in. </p><p>There are 10 players this year, and I only know four of them — Kelsey, Sarah, Erika and Taylor — in real life. The rest are connected through Kelsey and Sarah, whom I became friends with during a study abroad semester in college. </p><p> <!-- %asset:217921400% --> </p><p>The group is a diverse one. Six work in Washington, D.C., including Kelsey and Sarah, who work for Customs and Border Protection and the Justice Department’s public affairs office, respectively. </p><p>Another is a scheduler for a house member from California, one just finished her masters in International and European Politics at the University of Edinburgh and another works for an automotive product manufacturer in Ohio.</p><p>“I had played one season of fantasy previously with people from work which was majority men, so it was exciting that I would be playing with all women,” Erika wrote in our email chain. “I work for an automotive product manufacturer in Columbus (Ohio) which is a male dominated industry, so having an all-lady league is a refreshing opportunity to discuss football with someone other than a middle aged father of three.” </p><p>Preach, girl. </p><p>We have Steelers fans, Giants fans, Patriots fans, Browns fans and fans of watching football with friends on Sunday afternoons. </p><p>And of course, we have me. You’d think a football writer would have an unfair advantage in a fantasy football league. </p><p>You’d also be wrong. </p><p>To be clear, I’m not bad because I don’t understand how it works. I’m bad because I’m a big softy. I draft guys who I’ve covered and ones who I have a genuine interest in following off the field. It mimics my approach for telling stories on the beats I cover, which works great for reporting and not so much for competitive fantasy football leagues. <br/><br/></p><p>Last year Erika — team name Gurley Show — won the league, and Sarah came in second. Laura, known this year as Gronk A Donk, was third. Honestly, I have no idea where I finished, but I know that I didn’t win any money. Based on the fact that I had the third pick this year, I’m guessing I was somewhere toward the bottom. <br/><br/></p><p>With my drafting habits, I know that’s shocking. </p><p>I know some fantasy leagues have elaborate draft ceremonies and make an event out of it. That’s not what we did. Kelsey, the commissioner, sent out an email Sunday night to schedule it. We exchanged emails in a thread through Monday afternoon and hastily decided that Monday night worked best for all of us. </p><p>Because Sarah was catching a flight and others had other fantasy drafts, Kelsey gave us 30 seconds per pick. </p><p>Talk about stress. </p><p>I can’t pick out what scented candle I want at Target in 30 seconds, much less decide on which players will help me to a yet another mediocre finish. </p><p>My team — Post Mahomes — started out on a strong note, picking up Todd Gurley with my first selection. As a fellow North Carolinian, Gurley fits my rule of drafting guys I have some kind of connection to. </p><p>In between rounds, I tried to FaceTime my fiancé for some advice, but things were moving so quickly that I got stressed and ended the call before he could really help. Big mistake. </p><p>He did advise me to draft Christian McCaffrey, which I did. I briefly covered McCaffrey’s brother, Max, at Duke, so it still adheres to my draft method. </p><p>In the next round, I finally put my NFL knowledge to use. I was torn between drafting Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, but ultimately went with Kelce because I think he’ll get more targets than Hill based on the preseason. </p><p>Then I started to panic in the 30-second windows.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">I drafted both </span>Demaryius Thomas<em> </em>and Emmanuel Sanders in back-to-back rounds. I don’t have a good explanation for it, either. I was about to autodraft a defense out of my cue in the seventh round, and I saw Sanders’ name on the list of top available players, so I just pulled the trigger with a second left. Their Bye Week is going to be painful. </p><p>It turns out I wasn’t the only one who panicked under pressure. </p><p>Taylor drafted three defenses and three quarterbacks, and Kelsey forgot to draft a backup quarterback. </p><p>I feel good about my starting lineup — Deshaun Watson, Gurley, McCaffrey, Thomas, Jarvis Landry, Kelce, Sanders, Bears defense and Sebastian Janikowski. My bench is almost entirely players from OU, UNC or North Carolina: Adrian Peterson, Sterling Shepard, Tarik Cohen, Kenny Stills, Gio Bernard and Mitch Trubisky. Calvin Ridley rounds out the bench as the only non-NC or OU tie. </p><p>This week, I’m opening up the season against Kelsey (team name: Captain Kirk And The Giants). She’s ultra-competitive, so I’m already preparing to get my butt kicked. She’s starting Phillip Rivers — bolo tie and all — against KC’s secondary, so I like her chances even more. </p></div>",

But that’s exactly what the oddsmakers in Vegas must do anyway.</p><p>And they envision the Chiefs taking a step backwards, albeit a small one.</p><p>After three consecutive double-digit win seasons, Vegas has placed the Chiefs’ regular season over-under for wins at 8 1/2, according to Bovada. They need nine victories, in other words, to make the over wager a winning ticket.</p><p>The oddsmakers don’t like the Chiefs’ chances to repeat as the AFC West champions either. The Los Angeles Chargers are listed as the favorite to win the division, followed by the Chiefs.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p>Kansas City’s odds to win the Super Bowl are 25-to-1, which falls into the middle of the pack in the NFL. The Patriots are the favorite at 5-to-1, with the Eagles and Rams both 8-to-1.</p><p>What do the odds suggest about the statistical seasons the individual players might produce?</p><p>Let’s start with Mahomes. They have the over/under lines listed at 3,750 yards, 23 touchdowns and 13 1/2 interceptions. Only four players have higher interception totals. But the ceiling on Mahomes remains relatively high. He’s listed at 60-to-1 to win the league’s most valuable player award, tied for the 20th best odds in the NFL. For comparison’s sake, Alex Smith had 4,042 yards, 26 touchdowns and five interceptions in 2017.</p><p>Running back Kareem Hunt led the league in rushing as a rookie last season, finishing with 1,327 yards, eight rushing touchdowns. His 2018 projections in Vegas are 1,150 rushing yards and 10 1/2 rushing touchdowns, per Bovada. Ten players have better odds to win the rushing title than Hunt, even though he holds the belt.</p><p>The forecast for tight end Travis Kelce and wide receiver Tyreek Hill are quite similar. Each has their over/under for receiving yards listed at an even 1,000. Hill’s over/under for total touchdowns — receiving, rushing and returning combined — are seven. Kelce’s receiving touchdowns are listed at six. Hill had 1,183 yards and eight total touchdowns in 2017. Kelce had 1,038 yards and eight touchdowns.</p><p>So why do the sports betting oddsmakers set Kelce and Hill with slightly worse outputs this year? A couple of factors are at play. First, they don’t believe Mahomes will repeat the season Smith had last year. And second, there is another player to split the touches with.</p><p>Incoming wide receiver Sammy Watkins’ over/under for yards and touchdowns in his first season in Kansas City are 800 and 5 1/2, respectively. Those are much higher numbers than the Chiefs got from their No. 2 wide receiver a year ago. While Watkins caught eight scores last season, the yardage would be a significant bump in his production. Watkins had only 593 yards in 2017 with the Rams and just 430 yards in an injury-ravaged season in 2016. An injury, of course, would not negate the wager.</p><p>On the defensive side, linebacker Justin Houston is calculated for eight sacks. Houston has proved one of the most difficult players for Vegas to set lines, given his injury history. He had 9 1/2 sacks in 2017 but only four in 2016 and just 7 1/2 in 2015.</p><p>In their opener, the Chiefs are a 3 1/2-point underdog against the Chargers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> <br/><br/></span></p><p> <!-- %asset:217344670% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>This summer’s public forums on the future of Santa Fe Commons Park in downtown Overland Park generated one clear message from residents: <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/community/joco-913/article215357265.html\" target=\"_blank\">Don’t move the Farmers’ Market to the park</a>.</p><p>But the question remained, how could the city upgrade the space that is downtown’s central park and make it a more vibrant destination for residents, families and visitors?</p><p>On Wednesday night, the council’s community development committee voted unanimously for a plan that keeps the market where it is, at 7950 Marty St., but provides a new performance space, playground and enhanced green space within the park at 8045 Santa Fe Drive. The plan goes to the full council Oct. 1 for consideration.</p><p>“There’s a lot of things that we don’t have that we’ve been asked about over the years,” Park Services Director Greg Ruether told the committee. “What new could go into this location?”<br/><br/></p><p>The budget for the park improvements is $3 million and Ruether said the approved concept is designed to keep to that funding limit. Of the $3 million, $1 million is coming in a donation from retired car dealer Frank Thompson, a longtime philanthropist from Overland Park, and his wife Evangeline. </p><p>On Aug. 6, the city council approved an agreement that calls for Santa Fe Commons Park to be renamed Thompson Park once the upgrades are completed.</p><p>Amenities would include improved restrooms and shelters, a water feature with spray or mist, a contemporary children’s playground, natural play areas and space for table tennis, and a new open performance venue with a “paper airplane” shaped roof that would be a nod to Overland Park’s transportation past. </p><p>The conceptual plan was dubbed “Park Stroll,” by the Omaha-based RDG Planning &amp; Design landscape architecture firm, which came up with <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article213247329.html\" target=\"_blank\">four concepts for the city</a> to consider over the summer. Two concepts were for the park only, and two were for incorporating the farmers’ market into the park. Following several public forums and meetings with downtown business advocates and other stakeholders, Ruether said, the “Park Stroll” concept was the consensus choice.</p><p>It would preserve the existing Carriage House, which dates from the early 1900s, and keep as many of the healthy trees as possible. It calls for replacing the deteriorating bandstand and broken sidewalks and fixing or replacing other aging infrastructure.</p><p>Bruce Niedermyer with RDG said the southern half of the park would remain as open and natural as possible, to create an urban lawn, almost like a “front yard,” for the nearby Santa Fe Towers apartments, whose many residents cherish the park and didn’t want substantial changes.</p><p>Ruether said he had appreciated his meeting with the Santa Fe Towers residents, describing them as “the nicest and most opinionated people.” He said the debate over moving the farmers’ market had been polarizing, but it was a useful discussion, and the feedback from <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article213247329.html\" target=\"_blank\">well over 100 city residents</a> and other stakeholders had been crucial to the city’s decision on the best direction for the park. </p><p>Many people felt shoehorning the farmers’ market into the park would reduce the desirable green space while also cramping the market. Parking was also a concern. City officials have determined that improving the market at its present location honors its 36-year history and is the best option, although those construction upgrades will have to be phased in over time to minimize disruptions to vendors and customers.</p><p>Some residents now have a new concern: they’ve objected to the renaming, arguing it was done with no public input. They believe the Santa Fe Commons name should be preserved and is a better tie to Overland Park’s historical connection to the Santa Fe Trail. But the committee took no testimony on the renaming Wednesday night.</p><p>About three dozen people attended Wednesday’s public hearing, and several testified that they were relieved and pleased with the chosen concept.</p><p>“I think that can make a beautiful addition to our city,” said Linda McGuckin, who lives nearby.</p><p>Others questioned some of the elements.</p><p>“I treasure the fact that the park is natural,” said Rich Kaufman, adding that he thinks all the new park structures will detract from its natural character. He thought the “paper airplane” shaped roof for the performance space was silly and advised, “Get rid of that element. Make it a glider.”</p><p>Kaufman and several others also wondered why the park improvements need to occur now. They suggested the city should wait until multiple downtown construction projects are completed in a few years to see if park changes are really needed.</p><p>But Councilman Paul Lyons opposed waiting and said the city can coordinate the park construction with other projects to try to reduce parking problems and inconvenience.</p><p>“I think we should go full steam ahead,” he said. “I think it’s going to be a great amenity.”</p><p>If the council approves the concept, more detailed designs go to the Overland Park Planning Commission, probably late this year or early next year.

There have been no injuries or accidents, according to the manufacturer.</p><p>“Ford’s investigation found that some front seat belt pretensioners can generate excessive sparks when they deploy. When sufficient sparks are present, gases exhausted inside the lower portion of the B-pillar by the pretensioners may ignite. If this gas ignites, components behind the B-pillar such as insulation and carpet may subsequently catch fire.”</p><p>Under the recall, dealers will fix the problem for free. Dealers will remove insulation material and some wiring harness tape as well as treat the carpet and insulation with heat-resistant tape, the recall notice said. </p><p>Ford said dealers also would modify the back interior panels of regular cab trucks as part of the fix.</p></div>",

She also previously told the Australian-based court that <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/devout-us-woman-jailed-for-smuggling-cocaine-in-her-high-heels-20180906-p5022m.html\" target=\"_blank\">she fell in love with that man</a>, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The woman has been involved with the order for at least five years, Fox reported, and once considered becoming a nun. </p><p>In January, she pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug, Fox reported. On Thursday, she was <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/denise-woodrum-jailed-australia-cocaine\" target=\"_blank\">sentenced to seven and a half years in prison</a> with a non-parole period of four and a half years, BuzzFeed News reported. </p><p>Woodrum’s laywer, though, believed she had been “groomed” to help Cornelius.</p><p>“There are fraudsters out there who are relying on women who are vulnerable,” attorney Rebecca Neil said  in court, according to the Morning Herald. </p><p>The online couple had texted each other hundreds of romantic messages, BuzzFeed reported, and Woodrum told the court she was scammed by Cornelius and committed the crime “on the promise of a future together.” </p><p>But the judge disagreed that Woodrum, who lived near the Lake of the Ozarks, was “duped,” The Morning Herald reported.</p><p>“I do not accept that she is genuinely contrite for her offending as opposed to being sorry for the situation she now finds herself caught in,” Judge Penelope Wass said on Thursday. “She continues to blame others for her own reckless actions and appears to have little or no insight into her offending.” </p><p>Representatives for Australia’s Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions told The Washington Post that when Woodrum was in the airport, she said she was going to Sydney to see the Harbour Bridge and the aquarium.

    "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Small numbers of ballots in Johnson and Sedgwick counties are at the center of dispute between the backers of Gov. Jeff Colyer and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach in a primary race that may eventually be settled in court.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kansas law allows unaffiliated voters to declare their party on Election Day and vote in the primary, but the supporters of the two Republican rivals disagree whether this law puts the burden on voters or poll workers to ensure the paperwork is properly completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">And the state’s two largest counties <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216489915.html\">don’t appear to be handling the issue uniformly.</a></p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker, the deputy whom Kobach has tapped to oversee vote counting in the historically close election, said in a news release Sunday night that “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216584870.html\">Rucker issued his release less than 12 hours</a> before the bulk of the state’s counties, including its two most populous, were set to begin canvassing, a process that will determine whether <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article216446680.html\">thousands of provisional ballots count</a> in a race where a few hundred votes separate the candidates. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Brant Laue, Colyer’s chief counsel, argued in a letter Monday morning that Kansas law requires counties to accept ballots from unaffiliated voters regardless of whether the registration switch was completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Laue said on letterhead from the governor’s office.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Both Johnson and<a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\"> Sedgwick counties </a>voted to accept thousands of provisional ballots Monday, but a handful of ballots in each of the counties could be at the center of litigation if the primary fails to yield a clear winner after canvassing is completed.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach saw his lead on Colyer grow to 206 votes by 5 p.m. as more than 60 smaller counties processed their provisional ballots. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sedgwick and Johnson counties, which account for more than 40 percent of the state’s provisional ballots, will certify their new vote totals Tuesday.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Rucker <a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\">called Sedgwick County to complain</a> immediately after the county’s canvassing board voted to approve 14 ballots where an unaffiliated voter failed to check the box for party label. He argued with the county’s lawyer about the legality of their inclusion in the vote tally. </p>\n            <h3>Confusion in JoCo</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">In Johnson County, Colyer’s campaign staff left a canvassing meeting thinking that the state’s most populous county would be counting all unaffiliated voters who cast ballots in governor primary.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">But it appears that Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker misspoke on the issue, leading to confusion about which ballots will be counted when Johnson County does its final tally on Tuesday.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Metsker referred to questions about the status of unaffiliated voters who were wrongly told to cast provisional ballots at their polling places and said votes would be counted for 57 unaffiliated voters in Johnson County who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">After the meeting, The Star asked Metsker specifically whether this meant that voters who were told to cast provisional ballots instead of declaring a party would see their votes counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“That’s correct. We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Clay Barker, Colyer’s special assistant, took Metsker’s assurances as a sign that the county was not following Rucker’s guidance.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“It would appear to me that the county commissioners, with counsel from their elections commissioner and legal counsel, decided to ignore it and do what they’ve done in the past, which is count ballots because they show a poll worker’s mistake,” said Barker, an attorney who previously served as executive director of the Kansas Republican Party.</p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216595325% -->\n            </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The Johnson County Board of Canvassers voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 provisional ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations. The 57 ballots from unaffiliated voters that declared parties are part of that total.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">But the board also voted unanimously to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons, including 35 ballots for which a voter failed to declare a party.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach’s spokeswoman, Danedri Herbert, contacted The Star shortly after the meeting to emphasize the distinction.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“I just think it’s important to understand the difference because other counties are now trying to follow Johnson County’s lead,” Herbert said.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Ed Eilert, who chairs the canvassing board and the Johnson County Commission, said he thought the distinction between which unaffiliated voters would count and which would not was clear at the meeting.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Regarding the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t count, Eilert said, most were mail-in ballots, according to his notes.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“There’s a place on there if you’re unaffiliated to mark the party and they didn’t,” Eilert said. “That’s the difference between the two.”</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The canvassing board, which is made up by the county’s commissioners, also voted to accept 275 ballots in part. Most of these ballots are from people who went to the wrong polling place on Election Day. Their votes for all statewide races, such as the primary for governor, will count.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"> Colyer’s campaign referred to Laue’s letter when asked about the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t be counted.</p>\n            <h3>More scrutiny in Sedgwick County</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The issue of unaffiliated voters received more scrutiny in Sedgwick County.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sedgwick County Commissioner David Dennis said it would have been easy for voters to miss what he called the “tiny box” on the form.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">And Sedgwick County Commissioner Jim Howell said the voters would have had to tell election workers which party they wanted to join to obtain a ballot. He also said he thinks the election officials at the polls should have checked that the form was completed before giving a ballot to the voter. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Tabitha Lehman, the county’s election commissioner, remained neutral on the issue of whether the votes should be counted. But she did say she trains poll workers not to advise voters on how to fill out the forms because she doesn’t want them to be seen as encouraging voters to affiliate with one party or another.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">The confusion for voters was scorned by Cille King, a co-president for the League of Women Voters of Kansas. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">If poll workers instructed the voter wrong, “I don’t think the voter should be penalized,” King said.</p>\n            <h3>Other counties</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">In 11 other Kansas counties surveyed by The Star that sorted through provisional and mail-in votes Monday, there was no question that previously unaffiliated voters’ ballots would be counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Rick Piepho, the county clerk and election officer of Harvey County, said unaffiliated voters should declare a party simply by going through the provisional ballot process.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“On the provisional envelope — at least on ours — there’s a box on there that says I’m declaring such-and-such ... party and we have them declare on there, so when they’re signing the provisional envelope they’re also signing that declaration,” Piepho said. </p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Most poll workers in these smaller counties asked unaffiliated voters to fill out a voter affiliation card or a voter registration card to declare their party, and they were given a standard ballot to vote in that party’s primary, clerks said. A few voters were asked to vote provisionally, which clerks attributed to poll worker error, but those votes were counted.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“They had to fill out a card in order to be able to get a ballot,” McPherson County Clerk Hollie Melroy said.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Sonya Stohs, county clerk in Marshall County, said 18 unaffiliated voters at two polling places in her county were asked to fill out provisional ballots because of poll worker error, but they all counted. </p>\n            <h3>Postmarks and other issues</h3>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Among the 898 votes thrown out Monday in Johnson County were four mail-in ballots that lacked a postmark or had an illegible postmark.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Kobach’s office advised counties that these types of ballots could not be counted last week, which prompted Colyer to call on the state’s chief election official to recuse himself from the process.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Votes won’t count for an additional 59 people who did not provide photo ID as required by Kansas law. And 272 people registered in one party tried to vote in the other party’s primary.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">One voter died after casting a ballot, which prompted the election office to recommend the vote be treated as invalid.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">“We only had one of those, thank God,” Metsker told the commissioners.</p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216341105% -->\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <!-- %asset:216340375% -->\n            </p>\n          </div>",

            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Kansas’ two biggest counties made different decisions on how to count some ballots from last week’s election, meaning that some Sedgwick County voters who messed up on a form will have their votes count, while Johnson County voters who did the same thing won’t.</p><p>The conflict only affects 49 ballots out of more 200,000 cast statewide. In an ordinary election year it probably would have gone unnoticed. </p><p>But this time, those could be critical votes with Secretary of State Kris Kobach leading Gov. Jeff Colyer in the Republican race for governor by only 206 votes at the end of the business day Monday. </p><p>At issue are disputed provisional ballots, which were cast by voters who tried to switch from no-party status to affiliating with a party so they could vote in the primary on election day.</p><p>State law allows that last-minute switch, but there is a form for that and some voters didn’t fill out the form correctly.</p><p>Sedgwick County officials voted Monday to give those voters the benefit of the doubt; Johnson County officials voted to toss the ballots out.</p><p>Those decisions affect 14 Sedgwick County votes and 35 Johnson County votes.</p><p>Overall, Sedgwick County’s election board voted to count 1,326 provisional and disputed ballots, adding them to the total votes from the Aug. 7 primary election. </p><p>The results will be announced Tuesday morning.<br/><br/></p><p>The most disputed were 14 ballots cast at the polls by unaffiliated voters who indicated they wished to declare a party and vote in the primary, but who failed to check a box indicating the party of their choice on the form.</p><p>The election board voted 4-1 to count those votes.</p><p>The board is by law made up of the members of the Sedgwick County Commission. On Monday, one commissioner, Richard Ranzau, couldn’t be there, so his seat was taken by Karen Bailey, the chief deputy county clerk who was appointed as substitute. </p><p>Bailey was the only “no” vote on counting the 14 disputed ballots.</p><p>Commissioner David Dennis said it would have been easy for voters to miss what he called the “tiny box” on the form.</p><p>And Commissioner Jim Howell said the voters would have had to tell election workers which party they wanted to join to obtain a ballot. He also said he thinks the election officials at the polls should have checked that the form was completed before giving a ballot to the voter. </p><p>Election Commissioner Tabitha Lehman remained neutral on the issue of whether the votes should be counted. But she did say she trains poll workers not to advise voters on how to fill out the forms because she doesn’t want them to be seen as encouraging voters to affiliate themselves with one party or another.</p><p>The decisions of which votes to count were part of canvassing the vote, a process that is usually ministerial and noncontroversial. But it’s been magnified this election because of the whisker-thin margin in the race for the Republican nomination for governor.</p><p>Immediately after the decision to count the 14 disputed ballots, Kobach’s assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker called to object, arguing over the legality of the decision with Sedgwick County Counselor Eric Yost.<br/><br/></p><p>Under pressure from Colyer and his campaign team, Kobach has recused himself from overseeing the election. He appointed Rucker, his employee and a supporter of his campaign, to act as chief election official in his place.</p><p>The ballots approved by the election board are now being counted by election office workers.</p><p>Many of those ballots will have to be counted by hand.</p><p>Results are expected to be reported at 10 a.m. Tuesday at the Historic Courthouse downtown.<br/><br/></p><p>While Sedgwick County has decided to count the disputed ballots from unaffiliated voters the state’s other major county decided not to. </p><p> <!-- %asset:216595325% --> </p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker apparently misspoke on the issue Monday morning, leading to confusion for the Colyer campaign and others about which ballots will be counted when Johnson County does its final vote tally Tuesday afternoon.<br/><br/></p><p>Metsker said 57 unaffiliated voters in Johnson County who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots would have their votes counted.</p><p>After the meeting, The Kansas City Star asked Metsker specifically whether this meant that voters who were told to cast provisional ballots without declaring a party would see their votes counted.</p><p>“That’s correct. We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied. “These are citizens. We train them. We train them hard. There were a number of problems at that location.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216610415% --></p><p>However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party.</p><p>“This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.”</p><p>But that doesn’t include the 35 other provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who did not mark a form to declare a party. Those votes will be disallowed.</p><p>The Johnson County election board voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations.</p><p>The board also voted to accept 275 ballots in part and to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons. </p><p>The Johnson County board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.<br/><br/></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"436\" style=\"width: 327pt;\"> <colgroup><col width=\"368\"

Jeff Colyer’s office as the feud between the two Republican candidates continues. </p><p>As county canvassing boards began to meet Monday to review provisional votes, Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker said in an email late Sunday that “there has been considerable public discussion regarding whether unaffiliated voters can participate in Kansas party primary elections.”</p><p>He then attached a series of legal instructions including that “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p><p>Under Kansas law, unaffiliated voters are able to declare a party at the polls, and then vote in that party’s primary. Kansas law does not allow for open Republican and Democratic primaries.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign late last week voiced concerns about unaffiliated voters who were incorrectly told by poll workers to cast provisional ballots.</p><p>The governor’s office argued in a legal opinion sent to The Star Monday morning that “Kansas law requires canvassers to look to the intent of the voter” in cases where a poll worker incorrectly tells an unaffiliated voter to cast a provisional ballot, rather than to affiliate and then vote.</p><p>“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Brant Laue, the chief legal counsel of the governor’s office, said in the letter.</p><p>Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, has a <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article216487350.html\" target=\"_self\">slim lead, 110 votes, over Colyer in the GOP primary for governor</a>. Roughly 9,000 provisional ballots are spread across the state’s 105 counties. More than 40 percent of those ballots come from Johnson and Sedgwick counties, where Kobach has appointed the top election officials.</p><p>After initially resisting calls that he recuse himself from duties overseeing the election, Kobach eventually recused himself last week and named Rucker.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign also has alleged that “many Colyer voters had difficulties finding his name on the ballot, were forced to vote on provisional ballots, or were turned away outright for unknown reasons.”<br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:216521210% --></p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Gov. Jeff Colyer’s campaign staff left Monday morning’s canvassing meeting in Johnson County with the belief that the state’s most populous county would be counting all unaffiliated voters who cast ballots in the primary for governor. </p><p>But it appears that Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker misspoke on the issue Monday morning, leading to confusion for the Colyer campaign and others about which ballots will be counted when Johnson County does its final vote tally Tuesday. </p><p>Metsker referred to questions about the status of unaffiliated voters who were wrongly told to cast provisional ballots at their polling places and said 57 unaffiliated voters in Johnson County who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots would have their votes counted. </p><p>After the meeting, The Star asked Metsker specifically whether this meant that voters who were told to cast provisional ballots instead of declaring a party would see their votes counted. </p><p>“That’s correct. We had one location where that happened,” Metsker replied. “These are citizens. We train them. We train them hard. There were a number of problems at that location.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216610415% --> </p><p>However, Metsker issued a clarification Monday afternoon saying the county would count only those unaffiliated voters who declared a party. </p><p> “This morning, the Board of County Canvassers voted to count 57 provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who were mistakenly instructed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day,” Metsker said in a statement provided by a county spokeswoman. “I recommended those provisional ballots be counted because those voters completed a voter registration application, which includes a party affiliation declaration, as a part of the provisional ballot process.” </p><p>The distinction affects 35 other ballots cast by unaffiliated voters who did not declare a party and won’t have their ballots counted.</p><p>The Johnson County Board of Canvassers voted unanimously Monday to fully accept 1,176 ballots based on Metsker’s recommendations. </p><p> The canvassing board, which is made up by the county’s commissioners, also voted to accept 275 ballots in part and to disregard 898 ballots for a variety of reasons. The majority of voters who will only have their ballots partially counted went to the wrong polling place on Election Day. Their votes for all statewide races, such as the primary for governor, will count.</p><p>The board will reconvene at 4 p.m. Tuesday to certify the county’s election results after the new ballots have been counted.</p><p>Colyer’s campaign raised concerns last week that unaffiliated voters who were incorrectly told to cast provisional ballots would not have their votes counted.</p><p>Kansas law allows unaffiliated voters to declare a party on the day of the primary to vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary.</p><p>Assistant Kansas Secretary of State Eric Rucker issued a guidance late Sunday night saying that if “if an unaffiliated voter does not complete a party affiliation document, that voter is not entitled to vote at a party primary election.”</p><p>Clay Barker, Colyer’s special assistant, took Metsker’s assurances at the Monday meeting as a sign that the county was not following Rucker’s guidance. </p><p>“It would appear to me that the county commissioners with counsel from their elections commissioner and legal counsel decided to ignore it and do what they’ve done in the past, which is count ballots because they show a poll worker’s mistake,” said Barker, an attorney who previously served as executive director of the Kansas Republican Party.</p><p>Kobach’s spokeswoman, Danedri Herbert, contacted The Star shortly after the meeting to dispute that all of these ballots were being accepted. </p><p>“I just think it’s important to understand the difference, because other counties are now trying to follow Johnson County’s lead,” Herbert said. </p><p>Ed Eilert, who chairs the canvassing board and the county commission, said that he believes the distinction between which unaffiliated voters would count and which would not was clear at the meeting. </p><p>Regarding the 35 unaffiliated voters’ ballots that won’t count Eilert said that those are mostly mail-in ballots, according to his notes. </p><p>“There’s a place on there if you’re unaffiliated to mark the party and they didn’t,” Eilert said. “That’s the difference between the two.” </p><p>The issue also came up during Sedgwick County’s canvassing meeting. That county’s canvassing board voted<a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article216602730.html\" target=\"_blank\"> to accept 14 ballots cast by unaffiliated voters </a>who did not check a box marking party affiliation. </p><p>Rucker called Sedgwick County to object about the inclusion of the ballots immediately after the county’s vote, arguing about their legality with Sedgwick County Counselor Eric Yost. </p><p>The dispute could wind up in court. </p><p>Brant Laue, Colyer’s chief counsel, argued in a letter Monday morning that Kansas law requires counties to accept ballots from unaffiliated voters regardless of whether the registration switch was completed. Colyer’s campaign pointed back to this letter when asked for a comment about the confusion in Johnson County. </p><p>“Kansas law requires that provisional ballots cast by unaffiliated voters in a primary election be construed as evidence of voter intent and must be counted,” Laue said in a letter on letterhead from the governor’s office.</p><p>The confusion for voters was scorned by Cille King, a co-president for the League of Women Voters of Kansas. </p><p>If poll workers instructed the voter wrong, “I don’t think the voter should be penalized,” King said.</p><p>Among the 898 votes that were thrown out Monday in Johnson County were four mail-in ballots that lacked a postmark or had an illegible postmark.</p><p>Kobach’s office advised counties that these types of ballots couldnot be counted last week, which prompted Colyer to call on the state’s chiefelection official to recuse himself from the process.</p><p>An additional 59 people will not have their votes counted because they did notprovide photo ID as required by Kansas law. And 272 people tried to vote in theother party’s primary. </p><p>One voter died after casting a ballot, which prompted the election office to recommend the vote be treated as invalid.</p><p>“We only had one of those. Thank God,” Metsker told the commissioners.</p><p><!-- %asset:216341105% --> </p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

            "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Kansas Democrats don’t yet know which Republican they’ll face in the general election for governor. They says that’s a good thing.</p></div>",
            "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kansas Democrats are delighted by the continuing battle between Kris Kobach and Jeff Colyer in the Republican race for governor. The prolonged uncertainty over who will win the primary election effectively hands Democrats “buckets of free money,” they say.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Republican race for governor may remain undecided for weeks and potentially end in lawsuits. Democrats say the extended drama gives them a head start on fundraising and organizing going into the general election season.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“It’s as if the Republicans are handing us buckets and buckets of free money … it’s days their money isn’t being used to attack anybody,” said Chris Reeves, a Democratic national committeeman in Kansas.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans are downplaying the possibility the unresolved contest between Kobach and Colyer, the current governor, will ultimately harm them in November. But they acknowledge the standoff could slow fundraising on their side.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kansas Republican Party Chairman Kelly Arnold said the uncertainty about the nominee “makes it a little more difficult for the campaigns to raise money … until they know they’re the candidate.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“You’ve got a number of people … who kind of wait until after the primaries are over because they’re there to support our nominee,” Arnold said. “Many of them are still sitting on the sidelines waiting.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">On Friday, Kobach, the secretary of state, held a lead of 110 votes, according to his office. The margin will almost certainly change when county election officials begin sifting through provisional ballots Monday.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The final results may not be certified until Aug. 31. Recounts and litigation remain possible.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">“We want the Republicans to spend as much time as they need to while we’re out talking to voters about what the future looks like,” Kansas House Minority Leader Jim Ward, a Wichita Democrat, said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">State Sen. Laura Kelly easily won the Democratic nomination for governor on election night and transitioned into general election mode. She has said it doesn’t matter whether she ends up facing Colyer or Kobach.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“The longer the story is indecision, confusion, disunity on the Republican side, I think the better that is for Democrats,” said Ethan Corson, director of the Kansas Democratic Party.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans, on the other hand, are waiting for the vote counting process to finish.</p><p>Arnold called the unresolved race a “temporary obstacle” that the party will work around and said the situation won’t hurt Republicans.<br/><br/></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He said Republicans will begin attacking Kelly right away.<br/><br/></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“We kind of have campaign plan A and campaign plan A.1 depending on which candidate we have,” Arnold said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Political parties typically use the days following a primary to unite and mend relationships frayed during the primary campaign. Parties and campaigns also intensify outreach to donors and activists as they kick off the general election season.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But instead of unifying, tensions are rising between Kobach and Colyer, who became governor six months ago when Sam Brownback resigned.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Colyer on Thursday demanded Kobach recuse himself from providing advice to county election officers and said he had made statements on national TV that were inconsistent with Kansas law. Colyer also hinted at the possibility of litigation.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kobach said Friday afternoon in a letter to Colyer that he would recuse himself from overseeing vote counting but said the decision is symbolic because the counties count votes, not him. He named longtime deputy Eric Rucker to oversee the election in his stead, but the Colyer campaign said his appointment didn’t address their concerns about a conflict of interest.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kobach also said Colyer’s rhetoric risked undermining public confidence in the election process.</p><p><!-- %asset:216335185% --> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">An extended recount or legal process could damage Republicans if candidates become hostile toward each other, said Patrick Miller, a political scientist at the University of Kansas.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“That would cost them time and resources and any of that hostility that gets out in the media doesn’t help the eventual nominee. It doesn’t help heal the wounds that always occur with primaries,” Miller said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Given that Republican voters were sharply divided between Kobach and Colyer, Senate Vice President Jeff Longbine, an Emporia Republican, said Republicans must analyze the results to determine exactly what voters said and carry out a strategy based on that message.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“I think it’s extremely important at this point for the Republican Party to make sure that we are inclusive, that we are listening to everyone’s thoughts and ideas within the party and that we get that unification that we’re going to need to be successful in November,” Longbine said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite the current division, Miller said Republicans still have a built-in structural advantage over Democrats: independent Greg Orman. Miller predicts Orman will draw away Democratic voters.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orman, a Johnson County businessman, isn’t officially on the general election ballot yet. He turned in thousands of signatures Monday to secure a spot and is waiting on the secretary of state’s office to certify the signatures.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“(Republicans) can afford to have damaging events occur, or to nominate someone like Kobach who appears from the polling to be a weaker candidate than Colyer,” Miller said. “They can afford that because they have the opposition split.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orman has rejected the argument that he will only take votes from Democrats. He has said he will build a coalition of Democrats as well as Republicans and independents.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Asked Friday whether the current lack of a Republican nominee helps Orman, campaign spokesman Sam Edelen said that regardless of who the nominee is, “the choice voters will have in November will be clear”: between two career politicians or Orman, a businessman.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Republicans say they’re ready to move on to the general election.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">At a GOP unity breakfast on Wednesday, House Majority Leader Don Hineman, R-Dighton, called on Republicans in all political races to come together.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“What we need to remember is what happened yesterday was an intramural scrimmage,” Hineman said. “What’s coming up is a varsity match.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216340375% --> </p></div>",

              "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>The 2018 Kansas City Chiefs will be exciting. They also might miss the playoffs for just the second time in six years, which is sort of the plan.</p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p class=\"p1\">The secret of the most anticipated Chiefs season in years is that this is not a Super Bowl contender, no matter <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/for-petes-sake/article217786245.html\" target=\"_blank\">what some in the national media are saying</a>.</p><p class=\"p1\">Might not even be a playoff team.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is not written to inflame or mock. This is not written simply because Eric Berry’s health remains uncertain, or the defense looked awful in the preseason. This is a sober look at a team with a first-year starting quarterback, major questions on defense and perhaps most convincingly a line of personnel moves that are subtly but consistently pointing to a more serious push beginning in 2019.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is not a hot take, in other words.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is the plan.</p><p class=\"p1\">Look at the biggest moves. Alex Smith was traded for a Kendall Fuller, a young and rising cornerback, and draft picks, the higher of which comes next year. This happened because the team wanted to build around young quarterback Patrick Mahomes, a tantalizing talent but one who so far has only torched Big 12 defenses at Texas Tech.</p><p class=\"p1\">Cornerback Marcus Peters was also traded, essentially because the organization was tired of repairing and reinforcing and worrying in his wake. Peters is young and game-changing and still cheap. You think a team that believes it’s close to a Super Bowl gives up on that?</p><p class=\"p1\">Of course not, but a team that believes it’s close to a Super Bowl will trade for that, which is why the Rams added him to one of the league’s most talented rosters.</p><p class=\"p1\">The free-agent moves were done with the future in mind, too. Sammy Watkins is just 25, and his red zone effectiveness (seven of his eight touchdowns last year were 17 yards or less) is seen as a complement to the 24-year-old Tyreek Hill (10 of his 13 career touchdown catches are 30 yards or more) to aid the development of the 22-year-old Mahomes.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217921400% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">Anthony Hitchens is just 26, a three-down linebacker the Chiefs think pairs well with Reggie Ragland inside and, more importantly, can be a pillar aside Justin Houston and Eric Berry to strengthen what football people refer to as “the culture.” That’s not a quick fix.</p><p class=\"p1\">You see the commonality here? Get younger, create stable support for a first-year starting quarterback and build a culture that will help rather than impede.</p><p class=\"p1\">The truth is the Chiefs’ defense probably had too many holes to fix all in one offseason, but certain circumstances also played against them.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Chiefs may have prioritized Bears cornerback Kyle Fuller in free agency, and if so it would have been on brand. He’s Kendall’s brother, another dependable teammate, and he would’ve strengthened a premium position.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">But after the Bears used their franchise tag on Fuller, the backup options were less enticing. Trumaine Johnson and Malcolm Butler each had varying so-called “character” questions, which would’ve been a difficult sell while talking about culture.</p><p class=\"p1\">Aaron Colvin would’ve been an upgrade, but the price — $34 million including $18 million guaranteed — was high for a player now listed as a backup on the Texans’ depth chart.</p><p class=\"p1\">So, the Chiefs spent bigger money on fewer players, with the caveat that the talent would still be in prime years in 2019 and 2020.</p><p class=\"p1\">The roster is full of “development guys,” particularly in the secondary — corners Charvarius Ward and Tremon Smith, safety Jordan Lucas and to a slightly lesser extent Armani Watts. The Chiefs will have an extra second-round pick next year, and will likely draft at least one cornerback high.</p><p class=\"p1\">If that’s the way it goes, the biggest concern going forward could be the pass rush. The Chiefs need as much as they can get from Houston as he enters his 30s, and more importantly they need some real production from a second rusher.</p><p class=\"p1\">Dee Ford is the most likely to make an impact in 2018, but he’s inconsistent, with unreliable health, can be a liability against the run, and will be a free agent after the season.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217768120% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">Rookie Breeland Speaks may be better suited inside — he played there in college, and could make an effective tandem with Chris Jones rushing in sub packages. If that’s the way it goes, the Chiefs would need some combination of retaining Ford, getting regular production from Tanoh Kpassagnoh, drafting a pass rusher high, or picking through a free agent class that could include Jadeveon Clowney.</p><p class=\"p1\">The other thing going on here is a tangible priority on the defensive front, perhaps influenced by the current Super Bowl champions.</p><p class=\"p1\">The discussion around the Eagles’ run typically centers around (Reid protege) Doug Pederson’s creativity, and that’s obviously a critical element.</p><p class=\"p1\">But the Eagles also won with a defense that ranked fourth in points, fourth in yards and second in Football Outsiders’ DVOA with a group of corners that nobody would envy. The strength of that group was up front, and with the safeties. The Chiefs could try to emulate.</p><p class=\"p1\">Either way, the Chiefs are approaching this as more than a quick fix. That may mean fewer wins in 2018. If that’s the way this goes, it won’t be a failure.</p><p class=\"p1\">It’ll be the plan.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217344510% --> </p></div>",

The rest are connected through Kelsey and Sarah, whom I became friends with during a study abroad semester in college. </p><p> <!-- %asset:217921400% --> </p><p>The group is a diverse one. Six work in Washington, D.C., including Kelsey and Sarah, who work for Customs and Border Protection and the Justice Department’s public affairs office, respectively. </p><p>Another is a scheduler for a house member from California, one just finished her masters in International and European Politics at the University of Edinburgh and another works for an automotive product manufacturer in Ohio.</p><p>“I had played one season of fantasy previously with people from work which was majority men, so it was exciting that I would be playing with all women,” Erika wrote in our email chain. “I work for an automotive product manufacturer in Columbus (Ohio) which is a male dominated industry, so having an all-lady league is a refreshing opportunity to discuss football with someone other than a middle aged father of three.” </p><p>Preach, girl. </p><p>We have Steelers fans, Giants fans, Patriots fans, Browns fans and fans of watching football with friends on Sunday afternoons. </p><p>And of course, we have me. You’d think a football writer would have an unfair advantage in a fantasy football league. </p><p>You’d also be wrong. </p><p>To be clear, I’m not bad because I don’t understand how it works. I’m bad because I’m a big softy. I draft guys who I’ve covered and ones who I have a genuine interest in following off the field. It mimics my approach for telling stories on the beats I cover, which works great for reporting and not so much for competitive fantasy football leagues. <br/><br/></p><p>Last year Erika — team name Gurley Show — won the league, and Sarah came in second. Laura, known this year as Gronk A Donk, was third. Honestly, I have no idea where I finished, but I know that I didn’t win any money. Based on the fact that I had the third pick this year, I’m guessing I was somewhere toward the bottom. <br/><br/></p><p>With my drafting habits, I know that’s shocking. </p><p>I know some fantasy leagues have elaborate draft ceremonies and make an event out of it. That’s not what we did. Kelsey, the commissioner, sent out an email Sunday night to schedule it. We exchanged emails in a thread through Monday afternoon and hastily decided that Monday night worked best for all of us. </p><p>Because Sarah was catching a flight and others had other fantasy drafts, Kelsey gave us 30 seconds per pick. </p><p>Talk about stress. </p><p>I can’t pick out what scented candle I want at Target in 30 seconds, much less decide on which players will help me to a yet another mediocre finish. </p><p>My team — Post Mahomes — started out on a strong note, picking up Todd Gurley with my first selection. As a fellow North Carolinian, Gurley fits my rule of drafting guys I have some kind of connection to. </p><p>In between rounds, I tried to FaceTime my fiancé for some advice, but things were moving so quickly that I got stressed and ended the call before he could really help. Big mistake. </p><p>He did advise me to draft Christian McCaffrey, which I did. I briefly covered McCaffrey’s brother, Max, at Duke, so it still adheres to my draft method. </p><p>In the next round, I finally put my NFL knowledge to use. I was torn between drafting Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, but ultimately went with Kelce because I think he’ll get more targets than Hill based on the preseason. </p><p>Then I started to panic in the 30-second windows.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">I drafted both </span>Demaryius Thomas<em> </em>and Emmanuel Sanders in back-to-back rounds. I don’t have a good explanation for it, either. I was about to autodraft a defense out of my cue in the seventh round, and I saw Sanders’ name on the list of top available players, so I just pulled the trigger with a second left. Their Bye Week is going to be painful. </p><p>It turns out I wasn’t the only one who panicked under pressure. </p><p>Taylor drafted three defenses and three quarterbacks, and Kelsey forgot to draft a backup quarterback. </p><p>I feel good about my starting lineup — Deshaun Watson, Gurley, McCaffrey, Thomas, Jarvis Landry, Kelce, Sanders, Bears defense and Sebastian Janikowski. My bench is almost entirely players from OU, UNC or North Carolina: Adrian Peterson, Sterling Shepard, Tarik Cohen, Kenny Stills, Gio Bernard and Mitch Trubisky. Calvin Ridley rounds out the bench as the only non-NC or OU tie. </p><p>This week, I’m opening up the season against Kelsey (team name: Captain Kirk And The Giants). She’s ultra-competitive, so I’m already preparing to get my butt kicked. She’s starting Phillip Rivers — bolo tie and all — against KC’s secondary, so I like her chances even more. </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>In a league that prides itself on its unpredictable outcomes, the Chiefs embark on their 2018 schedule Sunday as a leading example. <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/sam-mellinger/article217601700.html\" target=\"_blank\">How will quarterback Patrick Mahomes perform</a> in his first season as a starter? <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/article217857025.html\" target=\"_blank\">Will Eric Berry even be on the field</a>?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p>Perhaps more than any year in recent memory, the Chiefs are a difficult team to forecast. But that’s exactly what the oddsmakers in Vegas must do anyway.</p><p>And they envision the Chiefs taking a step backwards, albeit a small one.</p><p>After three consecutive double-digit win seasons, Vegas has placed the Chiefs’ regular season over-under for wins at 8 1/2, according to Bovada. They need nine victories, in other words, to make the over wager a winning ticket.</p><p>The oddsmakers don’t like the Chiefs’ chances to repeat as the AFC West champions either. The Los Angeles Chargers are listed as the favorite to win the division, followed by the Chiefs.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p>Kansas City’s odds to win the Super Bowl are 25-to-1, which falls into the middle of the pack in the NFL. The Patriots are the favorite at 5-to-1, with the Eagles and Rams both 8-to-1.</p><p>What do the odds suggest about the statistical seasons the individual players might produce?</p><p>Let’s start with Mahomes. They have the over/under lines listed at 3,750 yards, 23 touchdowns and 13 1/2 interceptions. Only four players have higher interception totals. But the ceiling on Mahomes remains relatively high. He’s listed at 60-to-1 to win the league’s most valuable player award, tied for the 20th best odds in the NFL. For comparison’s sake, Alex Smith had 4,042 yards, 26 touchdowns and five interceptions in 2017.</p><p>Running back Kareem Hunt led the league in rushing as a rookie last season, finishing with 1,327 yards, eight rushing touchdowns. His 2018 projections in Vegas are 1,150 rushing yards and 10 1/2 rushing touchdowns, per Bovada. Ten players have better odds to win the rushing title than Hunt, even though he holds the belt.</p><p>The forecast for tight end Travis Kelce and wide receiver Tyreek Hill are quite similar. Each has their over/under for receiving yards listed at an even 1,000. Hill’s over/under for total touchdowns — receiving, rushing and returning combined — are seven. Kelce’s receiving touchdowns are listed at six. Hill had 1,183 yards and eight total touchdowns in 2017. Kelce had 1,038 yards and eight touchdowns.</p><p>So why do the sports betting oddsmakers set Kelce and Hill with slightly worse outputs this year? A couple of factors are at play. First, they don’t believe Mahomes will repeat the season Smith had last year. And second, there is another player to split the touches with.</p><p>Incoming wide receiver Sammy Watkins’ over/under for yards and touchdowns in his first season in Kansas City are 800 and 5 1/2, respectively. Those are much higher numbers than the Chiefs got from their No. 2 wide receiver a year ago. While Watkins caught eight scores last season, the yardage would be a significant bump in his production. Watkins had only 593 yards in 2017 with the Rams and just 430 yards in an injury-ravaged season in 2016. An injury, of course, would not negate the wager.</p><p>On the defensive side, linebacker Justin Houston is calculated for eight sacks. Houston has proved one of the most difficult players for Vegas to set lines, given his injury history. He had 9 1/2 sacks in 2017 but only four in 2016 and just 7 1/2 in 2015.</p><p>In their opener, the Chiefs are a 3 1/2-point underdog against the Chargers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> <br/><br/></span></p><p> <!-- %asset:217344670% --> </p></div>",

Conrad, offensive lineman George Asafo-Adjei, running back Benny Snell, outside linebacker Josh Allen and safety Mike Edwards.</p><p class=\"p2\">“Just hearing the crowd and I was like, ‘This is real. Let’s get after it,’” Daniel said smiling after Wednesday night’s practice.</p><p class=\"p2\">Get after it he did. The 6-foot-1, 242-pound junior from Paintsville presently leads the Southeastern Conference in tackles with 11 and two quarterback hurries. His 11 tackles were four more than he recorded all of last season.</p><p><!-- %asset:217922175; alt=\"undefined\" align=\"center\"% --></p><p class=\"p2\">“He didn’t stick out like a first-time starter,” Coach Mark Stoops said of Daniel, who had played mostly on special teams in his previous two seasons.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p class=\"p2\">“I haven’t looked at him that way because he’s been playing like that all spring, all camp. Really didn’t look at him as a first-time starter until you pointed that out to me right there. Because he’s just a guy that’s been around, been in our system and working hard.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p class=\"p2\"> <!-- %asset:217724580% --> <br/><br/></p><p class=\"p2\">There’s still plenty that Daniel can improve, both the linebacker and his position coach said this week. Defensive coordinator Matt House pointed to one play where if Daniel had dipped his shoulders, he would’ve had a tackle for loss, but Central Michigan got 3 yards on a run play instead.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>“Those are the plays, in order to be successful, you’ve got to make because it puts them in third-and-long instead of third-and-medium, which is huge,” House said.</p><p class=\"p2\">But House was pleased with what he saw overall from the inside linebacker spots.</p><p class=\"p2\">Getting the victory and being the team’s leading tackler were special, but being named a captain after a vote by his teammates made it extra special for Daniel on Saturday.</p><p class=\"p2\">That’s the dream no matter where a player is born or what team he grew up rooting for.</p><p class=\"p2\">“I’m forever thankful that my teammates think that highly of me,” Daniel said. “Every day I come in, my first goal is to try to be the best teammate I can possibly be. No matter if it’s in the locker room, on the field or off the field, these dudes are my brothers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p class=\"p2\">“For them to think of me as a captain as a junior going forward, I couldn’t be awarded a higher honor than that.”</p><h3>Saturday</h3><p class=\"p2\"><b>Kentucky at No. 25 Florida</b></p><p class=\"p2\"><b>When: </b>7:30 p.m.</p><p class=\"p2\"><b>TV:</b> SEC Network</p></div>",

He took second on a wild pitch and scored on a single by Pratto, the Legends’ first baseman.</p><p>After Rome tied it 1-1 in the top of the fifth inning, the Legends regained the lead in their half. Shortstop Cristian Perez singled, stole second and scored on a hit by catcher Sebastian Rivero. An inning later, Pratto drilled a solo home run to give the Legends a 3-1 lead and that’s how it ended.</p><p>“(Rome pitcher Alan Rangel) was working me away with the fastball tonight and he left one that caught a little bit of plate, I got barrel on it,” <a href=\"https://www.milb.com/milb/news/nick-pratto-executes-at-plate-for-lexington-legends/c-293494980\" target=\"_blank\">Pratto told MiLB.com</a>. “It felt good to see it go over. We had a little mixup because there’s a chain-link fence on top of the wall and it hit that, but I knew that four umpires couldn’t miss that ... because I heard it hit the fence.” </p><p> <!-- %asset:217913570% --> </p><p>Starting pitcher Jackson Kowar, who was taken by the Royals with the 33rd overall pick in this year’s draft, allowed a run on five hits with five strikeouts. Janser Lara gave up one hit in three shutout innings, and Tad Ratliff worked around a two-out double in the ninth for the save. </p><p>Game 2 is Friday night in Rome, Ga.</p></div>",

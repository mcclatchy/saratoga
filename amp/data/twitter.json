              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ amazing start to the season — 10 touchdowns, no interceptions — has helped the Chiefs to a pair of big road wins over the Chargers and Steelers.</p><p>It’s got Chiefs fans buzzing, and here’s the thing, members of the national media are also gushing over Mahomes. The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and Yahoo Sports all had stories about Mahomes’ quick start. I’ve included a snippet of what each person wrote and you can click the link to read the full stories, although some may require a paid subscription.</p><p>Here is what people are saying.</p><p>Adam Kilgore of the Washington Post wrote a story with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/09/16/the-nfl-belongs-to-patrick-mahomes-now/?utm_term=.3adf1cd21600\">“The NFL belongs to Patrick Mahomes now.”</a><br/><br/></p><p dir=\"ltr\">“His physical ability and phenomenal performances fail to encapsulate Mahomes’s place in the league,” Kilgore wrote. “He’s too physically gifted to be seen as a prototype — good luck finding the next mobile, 6-foot-3 quarterback who can throw it 70 yards in the air. But Mahomes — a collegiate product of the ‘Air Raid’ offense, a starting quarterback on his rookie deal, a triggerman for Andy Reid’s designs and a conductor of concepts taken from college football — is something close to an ideal of modern NFL quarterback. He fits into every way the league is leaning.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Reid’s schemes have become the model for how offense is played. Seven NFL head coaches once coached under Reid, including reigning Super Bowl winner Doug Pederson and the Chicago Bears’s Matt Nagy, whose creative play-calling would have been the talk of the league if not for Aaron Rodgers’s heroics last Sunday night in Green Bay’s comeback victory. Mahomes’s talent may have made him a star in any setting, but he landed with perhaps the best developer of quarterbacks and most influential offensive mind in the game.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kilgore concludes with this:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“And so Sunday may have only been a start for Mahomes. He will face stiffer challenges than Pittsburgh’s secondary, to be sure, and not every Sunday will feel like a glimpse into a fluorescent future of the sport. But through two weeks, Mahomes hasn’t only been the most impressive player in the league. He’s been a signpost of where the sport is headed.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Andrew Beaton of the Wall Street Journal wrote a story with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/patrick-mahomes-is-conquering-the-nfl-1537136770?mod=e2tws\">“Patrick Mahomes is conquering the NFL.”</a></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Beaton opened the piece by writing about the risk the Chiefs took in trading away Alex Smith, who had a great season, and making the unproven Mahomes the starter.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Two weeks into this season, it’s no longer reasonable to question if Mahomes is good, and it’s far more reasonable to ponder if Mahomes is great,” Beaton wrote. “That much was clear after his second consecutive monster game. He threw for six touchdowns in a 42-37 win against the Steelers—giving him 10 through the season’s first two weeks.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes, 22 years old, is now the youngest player in the Super Bowl era with a six-touchdown passing game. His 10 throwing scores are a record for the first two weeks of the season. But his eye-popping statistics, somehow, aren’t even the most jarring aspect of what he has done so far. That’s because somehow what he has done is less notable than how he has done it. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes has dazzled with heaves uncommon in the modern NFL, which has increasingly shifted toward favoring high-probability short passes over riskier and longer ones. Mahomes has taken that trend and blasted it to smithereens with the bazooka attached to the right side of his torso.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yahoo Sports’ Terez Paylor, the former Kansas City Star writer, had a column with the headline, <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/legend-patrick-mahomes-grows-chiefs-appear-found-qb-savior-013002515.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The legend of Patrick Mahomes grows as the Chiefs appear to have found their QB savior.”</a></p><p>Paylor mentioned the Chiefs’ past troubles against the Steelers and why Sunday’s win meant that much more in Kansas City.<br/><br/></p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes has shown it all in wins against the Steelers and Chargers, including a rifle arm, moxie and the ability to throw under duress and from different platforms. The Chiefs needed every last drop of his talent to come out with the win on Sunday, as Mahomes managed to outduel (Ben) Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh’s future Hall of Famer, who completed 39 of 60 passes for 452 yards and three touchdowns.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes’ numbers already look ridiculous on the surface, but his performance is even more impressive when you consider it came against a Steelers team whose reliance on a fire zone pressure – where five defenders rush the passer and while the others (including defensive linemen) drop into coverage — has vexed the Chiefs in all of their previous five meetings under Reid.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Paylor later added: “Time after time against the Steelers, Mahomes’ ability to keep his eyes up under pressure, scan the pocket and deliver lasers from different platforms and launch points made the difference. The Steelers even became so weary of seeing Mahomes defeat their blitz packages that by the end of the game, they’d started dialing back on the blitzing in lieu of dropping more men into coverage.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Do not underestimate the importance of this. It is the ultimate show of respect, one reserved almost solely for quarterbacks like Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady, guys who can use their brains and rocket arms to destroy the zone blitzes that naturally leave defenses thin on players in actual coverages.”</p><p>Finally, it should come as no surprise that Peter Schrager, who is on “Good Morning Football” on the NFL Network, was wowed by Mahomes on Sunday:</p><p> <!-- %asset:218530770% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>The national Sunspot Solar Observatory in an isolated, mountainous region of New Mexico was set to reopen Monday after it was shut down on Sept. 6 with little explanation.</p><p>The group that manages the facility announced on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SunspotSolarObs/\" target=\"_blank\">the observatory’s Facebook page Sunday</a> that it had been <a href=\"http://www.aura-astronomy.org/news/news.asp?newsID=389\" target=\"_blank\">“cooperating with an on-going law enforcement investigation of criminal activity that occurred at Sacramento Peak.”</a></p><p>During that time, said the statement from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aura-astronomy.org/\">Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy</a> (AURA), “we became concerned that a suspect in the investigation potentially posed a threat to the safety of local staff and residents. For this reason, AURA temporarily vacated the facility and ceased science activities at this location.”</p><p>Officials had said very little about why the observatory, near Alamagordo, shut down. <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/article218345090.html\" target=\"_blank\">Local law enforcement officials said the FBI was involved</a> in the closure — which the feds have not confirmed or denied — and the resulting lack of information led to all kinds of conspiracy theories.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.alamogordonews.com/story/news/local/2018/09/07/sunspot-observatory-south-cloudcroft-closed-due-security-issue/1227788002/\" target=\"_blank\">“It was our decision to evacuate the facility,”</a> AURA spokeswoman Shari Lifson said after the observatory closed, according to the Alamogordo Daily News. “I am actually not sure (when the facility was vacated) but it will stay vacated until further notice.”</p><p>According to the newspaper, Benny House, the sheriff of Otero County, said the FBI was involved in what he described as an elaborate shutdown process and said “the FBI is refusing to tell us what’s going on.”</p><p>“There was a Blackhawk helicopter, a bunch of people around antennas and work crews on towers, but nobody would tell us anything,” House told the Daily News.</p><p>He told the Albuquerque Journal his department got a call from “folks that work at the laboratory” who asked <a href=\"https://www.abqjournal.com/1219922/nm-solar-observatory-closed-authorities-mum.html\" target=\"_blank\">“if we could send a deputy to stand by while they were evacuating.</a> All the employees were packing up and leaving.”</p><p>Bureau spokesman Frank Fisher would neither confirm nor deny FBI involvement, according to the Journal.</p><p>The closing led people to wonder whether the closure had something to do with alien activity.</p><p>“Some say the evacuation could be part of a <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/mysterious-observatory-evacuation-stirs-alien-conspiracy-theories/\" target=\"_blank\">government effort to cover up a discovery involving aliens</a>, an impending solar flare or something else extra-planetary,” wrote the CNET technology website.</p><p>“<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9f8oyb/the_evacuation_of_the_national_solar_observatory/e5v1xjp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Others on Reddit</a> and elsewhere think the security issue may involve a foreign power attempting to use the observatory’s antennas to spy on nearby White Sands Missile Range.”</p><p>CNET noted that the U.S. military built the observatory in 1947, “when it realized the sun could interfere with radio communications. The National Science Foundation ran the facility from the 1960s until this year, when operation was transferred to AURA and New Mexico State University.”</p><p>The statement from AURA on Sunday said the observatory was closed “<span>based on the logistical challenges associated with protecting personnel at such a remote location, and the need for expeditious response to the potential threat.</span></p><p><span>“AURA determined that moving the small number of on-site staff and residents off the mountain was the most prudent and effective action to ensure their safety.”</span></p><p><span>The statement did not explain the “criminal activity” allegedly discovered at the observatory, or mention anything about arrests.</span></p><p><span>It did acknowledge how the “</span>lack of communications while the facility was vacated was concerning and frustrating for some.</p><p>“However, our desire to provide additional information had to be balanced against the risk that, if spread at the time, the news would alert the suspect and impede the law enforcement investigation. That was a risk we could not take,” said the statement.</p><p>Given the amount of attention online and in media around the world that the closure attracted, officials plan to have extra security around when the observatory reopens to handle an expected “unusual number of visitors to the site,” the Facebook statement said.</p><p>In some circles, the announcement of suspected “criminal activity” at the observatory hasn’t stopped speculation of something more sinister at hand.</p><p>“Is there more to the Sunspot National Solar Observatory story?” asks one poll that popped up on Twitter Monday morning.</p><p><!-- %asset:218528905% --> </p><p>The reopening might not be enough to silence the conspiracy theories, suggested Alan Boyle, the aerospace and science editor for GeekWire.</p><p>“The observatory’s staff of about nine employees should be back at work this week. It shouldn’t take long for nearby residents to be back in their homes, for researchers to be back at the Dunn Solar Telescope, and for tourists to be back at the Sunspot Visitors Center,” Boyle wrote.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2018/sunspot-solar-obervatory-not-aliens/\" target=\"_blank\">“But a full resolution of the mystery will have to wait until criminal charges are filed</a>, assuming that the investigation bore fruit.<br/><br/></p><p>“And if the mystery hangs on with no criminal charges, with no further disclosures, don’t be surprised if Agents Mulder and Scully tackle the Sunspot Incident in a future ‘X-Files’ episode.”</p><p><!-- %asset:217455315% --><span> <br/><br/></span></p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>After she says her male friend was suspended for wearing makeup, Jasmine Richards is fighting to change the rules for future students at her high school in Pearland, Texas. </p><p>“I’m really big on self-expression, <a href=\"https://abc13.com/education/alvin-isd-male-cosmetology-student-suspended-for-wearing-makeup-/4247380/\" target=\"_blank\">especially when it comes to being equal,”</a> Richards told KTRK. “I felt if girls should be able to wear makeup, then a boy should have no problem doing the same thing if that’s how he wants to express himself.”<br/><br/></p><p>Officials at Shadow Creek High School gave an in-school suspension to the teenage boy, who has not been identified, because <a href=\"https://www.khou.com/article/news/education/alvin-isd-reevaluating-ban-on-boys-wearing-makeup/285-593533499\" target=\"_blank\">he was wearing makeup while on school property</a>, Richards told KHOU. </p><p>Along with banning boys from wearing earrings and having hair that exceeds a “length touching the top of the shoulders,” the Alvin Independent School District’s dress code <a href=\"https://www.alvinisd.net/cms/lib/TX01001897/Centricity/Domain/281/Dress%20Code%202018-19%20as%20of%207.9.18.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">says that “boys may not wear make-up.”</a> </p><p>Richards said that rule is particularly unfair to her friend, <a href=\"https://abc13.com/education/alvin-isd-male-cosmetology-student-suspended-for-wearing-makeup-/4247380/\" target=\"_blank\">who is part of the high school’s cosmetology program.</a></p><p>“He does makeup every day in those classes,” she said, according to KTRK. “He also wears makeup on his own so he felt he should have the right to wear it to school like any girl would.”</p><p>So, in turn, Richards started <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/concerned-students-change-alvin-isd-dress-code\" target=\"_blank\">a petition on Change.org asking for a change to the school district’s dress code</a>. </p><p>It has received nearly 2,000 signatures as of Monday morning. </p><p>“A boy wearing makeup should not be considered any more distracting than a girl wearing makeup,” the petition reads. “These policies harm young boys by telling them that they are not allowed to participate in the same forms of self expression that girls are, simply because they are boys. </p><p>“This has to change.”</p><p>One person who signed the petition — identified as Parhis Arvie of Pearland, Texas — wrote that she supports changing the dress code to support boys who wear makeup because it’s a matter of equality. </p><p>“Why should certain people be prohibited from things when others aren’t,” she asked. “It is important for me to know that if my brother chooses to, that he will be allowed to wear whatever he feels comfortable in and on his own skin. This is not the 90’s anymore.”</p><p>Jennifer T, another person who signed the petition, said the same rules were around when she attended high school. </p><p>“These archaic rules were there in the 80s when I was in school nearby but come on!” she wrote. “It’s 2018 — we are striving toward gender equality. There should be no gender rules when it comes to dress code.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:217031410% --> </p><p>But not all residents seemed supportive of allowing boys to express themselves with makeup. A man named Luke Perry told KHOU that “if it was my kid, I wouldn’t want him wearing makeup to school.”</p><p>Daniel Combs, assistant superintendent of the Alvin Independent School District, said in a statement to Yahoo that <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/texas-school-district-re-evaluating-sexist-dress-code-student-suspended-wearing-makeup-class-184327043.html\" target=\"_blank\">he met with Richards and her friend to talk about the policy. </a>He reportedly said that “we started a great dialogue and allowed the students to share their insight.”</p><p>“As a district, we are going to put together a committee that will allow our community, our parents, as well as our students, to have a voice,” he told Yahoo, “and go back through the process to look at our dress code and, again, identify areas of concern and make recommendations.”</p><p>As changes to the dress code are considered, Richards said she hopes her actions can create a more inclusive space for the next slate of students. </p><p>“I want to leave with a more open and expressive type of environment if possible,” she told KTRK. “So I’d like to change that.”</p><p>In May, a Texas man said he was turned away from a bar in Kingsville because <a href=\"https://www.star-telegram.com/news/state/texas/article211024349.html\" target=\"_blank\">the security guard refused to let him in for wearing makeup.</a> Bobby Rodriguez said he drove 40 miles to dance at the Whiskey River nightclub, then was confronted by a “homophobic” bouncer.”</p><p>Rodriguez said he was allowed into the bar once he took it off. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.caller.com/story/news/education/2018/05/11/man-told-remove-makeup-gain-entry-corpus-christi-nightclub/603512002/\" target=\"_blank\">“I literally had to walk back to my car and rip my false lashes off and wipe off my lipstick,”</a> Rodriguez told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. “I was so upset. I mean, who wouldn’t be?”</p><div class=\"embed-infographic\"><div class=\"fb-post fb_iframe_widget\"><p>The nightclub’s owner called the accusations “a bunch of frivolous baloney” after conceding her club does have rules for how people of each gender are allowed to dress and present themselves, according to The Corpus Christi Caller-Times. </p><p> <!-- %asset:209824369% --> </p></div></div></div>",

Really loud.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The unbeaten Chiefs will make their 2018 home debut Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers, and it will be the first home start of quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ career. Kickoff is at noon and the game is on WDAF (Ch. 4).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Having knocked off the preseason AFC West favorite Chargers and long-time nemesis Pittsburgh, both on the road, the Chiefs are likely to be fired up for the game, too.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In fact, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickMahomes5/status/1041445889510920194\">Mahomes tweeted</a> after Sunday’s win over the Steelers: “We are just getting started..! We are coming home #ChiefsKindom”</p><p>I’m providing a quick overview of the next Chiefs’ opponent early in each week, and here are five things to know about the 49ers, 1-1.<br/><br/></p><h3>Jimmy G</h3><p>The 49ers were a preseason darling thanks to quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo’s strong finish to the 2017 season after being traded from New England to San Francisco. The Niners won their last five games and many expected they’d make the postseason behind Garoppolo.</p><p>But in the 49ers’ opener, Garoppolo threw three interceptions in a loss at Minnesota. On Sunday, San Francisco beat the Lions 30-27 but Garoppolo dodged a bullet. Nursing that three-point lead late in the game, the Lions’ Tracy Walker intercepted a pass that was returned to the San Francisco 7. Garoppolo was bailed out by a defensive holding call on the other side of the field.</p><p>Garoppolo has completed 33 of 59 passes for 467 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions this season.</p><h3>Meet Matt Breida</h3><p>San Francisco running back Matt Breida rushed for 138 yards against the Lions and broke off a 66-yard touchdown scamper that was the 49ers’ longest TD run in four seasons. A big block aided Breida:</p><p><!-- %asset:218528265% --></p><p>Breida, who is in his second season after signing as an undrafted free agent out of Georgia Southern, has 22 rushing attempts this season for 184 yards. Former Washington running back Alfred Morris has 86 yards rushing in 26 attempts.</p><h3>Red Zone troubles</h3><p>The 49ers made five trips to the red zone against the Lions but had to settle for a field goal three times. Garoppolo was sacked three times on those three drives that ended in field goals.</p><p>Against the Vikings in the opener, San Francisco got to the red zone four times. Here is what happened:</p><p>1. Morris fumbled at the 1</p><p>2. Settled for a 33-yard field goal</p><p>3. Scored a touchdown</p><p>4. Had to kick a 22-yard field goal.</p><p>So that’s nine trips to the red zone and just three touchdowns scored this season for the Niners.</p><h3>Richard Sherman</h3><p>The 49ers signed cornerback Richard Sherman this summer. He was a four-time Pro Bowler, a first-team All-Pro three times and won a Super Bowl with the Seattle Seahawks before coming to San Francisco.</p><p>Sherman made two tackles Sunday against the Lions and recovered a fumble in the 49ers’ season opener at Minnesota.</p><p>Heading into Monday night’s game, the 49ers rank 23rd in pass defense (278 yards per game) and are tied for the fourth-most touchdown passes allowed. Two of the top three are teams the Chiefs have played: Pittsburgh at No. 1 and the Chargers are tied for second with the Bills.</p><h3>A new receiver?</h3><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1041328126813458432\" target=\"_blank\">ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported</a> that the Cleveland Browns are expected to trade wide receiver Josh Gordon and hope to send him to a team in the NFC.</p><p>Gordon can’t dictate where the Browns will trade him, but he would like to go to Dallas or San Francisco, Schefter reported.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/49ers/article/John-Lynch-49ers-have-called-about-Browns-WR-13233684.php\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco Chronicle reported</a> that 49ers general manager John Lynch has contacted the Browns about Gordon.</p></div>",

Developers Eric Holtze and Whitney Kerr Sr. can’t possibly expect the Kansas City Council to go along with a plan to subsidize a high-end hotel when the community is just finally <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article217921460.html\" target=\"_self\">coming to grips</a> with its housing crisis.</p><p>And they can’t realistically expect there to be political will to allocate more in tax-increment financing when the community just went through an agonizing process over subsidies for the <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/development/article107783412.html\" target=\"_self\">new downtown convention hotel</a> just about a block away. Developers plan to sell $42.2 million in TIF bonds, coupled with $82.3 million in taxable bonds to complete the financing for that long-missing piece of our hotel lineup. Taxes that the hotel generates will repay those loans.</p><p>Toss a healthy dose of politics into these flames, and the prospects for “Hotel Bravo!” dim further. <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/steve-kraske/article218306545.html\" target=\"_self\">The first mayoral forum</a> took place last week with more than one contender expressing skepticism about approving TIFs for any project other than clearly blighted properties, preferably on the East Side. That’s why tax-increment financing was originally created.</p><p>It was mayoral contender and Councilman Quinton Lucas who pointed out that TIFs become massively unpopular every four years when candidates are running for office. This year will be no exception.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“I’d encourage the developer to sit down and renegotiate and think about a better package,” Lucas told us.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Councilwoman Jolie Justus, who’s not a candidate a mayor, said, “Clearly it would be wonderful to have those types of luxury hotels. But this is not the time to have that conversation.”</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Kansas City hotel market, which has gone from cruddy and outdated to fashionably well-stocked in seemingly the blink of an eye, might benefit from an ultra-sleek and wildly expensive four- or five-star luxury property. The location, across Wyandotte Street from the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts, makes sense for that select group of so-called “vanguard” travelers coming in from the coasts.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">So be it.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But Holtz and Kerr should regroup and repackage their initial Hotel Bravo! proposal with its sky bars and penthouse suites. Because as it stands now, this dog isn’t going to hunt. And it shouldn’t.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217291975% --> </p></div>",

Most favored protections for LGBTQ people.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Kay Barnes, former mayor of Kansas City, senior director for university engagement at Park University:</b> <span>“Yes.”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The barrier: </span>Lack of understanding and thus discrimination against members of the LGBT community.</p><p><b>Michael Barrett, Missouri State Public Defender director:</b> “Rationale for denying someone a basic need, whether it be a home, a job, or health care should be based on criteria that can be applied across the board and does not target classes of persons. Quite simply, it should not be legal to deprive someone of such a need based on the way they look, worship, or love.”</p><p>The barrier: “fear of excessive lawsuits.” </p><p><b>Brenda Bethman, director of UMKC Women’s Center:</b> “Yes, there needs to be state-level (ideally federal) protections in place — otherwise LGBTQ people will continue to face legal discrimination.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: Anti-LGBTQ prejudice is the biggest barrier.</p><p><b>Mark Bryant, attorney and former Kansas City Council member:</b> “It is unfortunate but Missouri law needs to protect LGBTQ people at work, in housing decisions and at private businesses. Otherwise, LGBTQ people will be subject to the same types of discrimination that persons of African-American, Mexican and foreign national descent suffer. The United States is great because it absorbs different people from different places and blends culture(s) into something new. LGBTQ people are talented and innovative. We should prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.”</p><p>The barrier: “Survey polls do not indicate broad support in Missouri for laws which prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.”</p><p><b>Mike Burke, attorney and former Kansas City Council member:</b> “The short answer is yes. Missouri needs to enter the 21st Century in its laws on discrimination. A nondiscrimination law on a statewide level would send a message nationally that we are a tolerant society. Our cities have already taken a lead on nondiscrimination but without state legislation we are behind the times.”</p><p>The barrier: “We have too many legislators who feel they need to play to the lowest denominator in their base rather than the population as a whole.”</p><p><b>Thomas Curran, president of Rockhurst University:</b> “The promotion of human dignity and the pursuit of the common good compels us to have laws in the state of Missouri that protect all people from discrimination at work, in matters of housing and in private business. When this is not the practice, we need to create laws that specifically protect any and all groups who have experienced discrimination in these matters.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Tragically, we come across circumstances and situations where the promotion and preservation of human dignity has not been practiced because it’s not believed that we are all created equal.”</p><p><b>Jack Danforth, former U.S. senator:</b> “<span>I think that people should be protected from discrimination based on sexual orientation, except I think that the law should allow for businesses and organizations to practice their religious beliefs when their religion does not recognize same-sex marriage.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Until very recently, most people had never heard of same-sex marriage, and could not imagine that it could exist. This has changed dramatically over a very few years as more and more people, especially young people, take same sex marriage for granted. As the years pass, there will be increasingly less opposition to it.”</span></p><p><b>Reza Derakhshani, UMKC associate professor of computer science and electrical engineering:</b> “Yes.” </p><p>The barrier: “Bitter and and emotionally charged partisan rivalries, catering to unfounded fears rather than evidence-based research.”</p><p><b>Jane Dueker, lawyer, radio host and former political adviser:</b> “Absolutely.”</p><p><span>The barrier: “I think there are religious objections from lawmakers. Some business groups object citing the creation of new lawsuits. Similar to gay marriage, I think the legislature will punt and force the courts to do the right thing and then say ‘it is settled.’”</span></p><p><b>Gwen Grant, Urban League of Greater Kansas City: </b>“Yes. These people should be added as a protected class in Missouri law, which should include language specific to sexual orientation and gender identity.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span>The barrier: “We’re a conservative state and the legislature reflects it.”</span></p><p><b>Jason Grill, media, public affairs and crisis communications consultant:</b> “<span>No individual should face discrimination at work or in their job in any case no matter race, creed, religion or sexual orientation.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Current political makeup and numbers in the Missouri General Assembly, as well as some viewpoints that private businesses can do what they choose and should not be regulated in this manner by the government.”</span></p><p><b>John Hancock, former chairman of Missouri Republican Party: </b>“<span>Nobody should be for discrimination.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Two potential hurdles: One is the need to respect religious conscience. The second is a reluctance to increase the amount of litigation.”</span></p><p><b>Deb Hermann, CEO of Northland Neighborhoods, Inc.: </b>“Yes.”</p><p>The barrier: “The House passed HB2100 last session — a good step. However, I am unsure of the governor’s action on this legislation. It needs to be approved. Ignorance inflamed by political rhetoric causes great damage to this cause.”</p><p><b>Bob Holden, former governor:</b> “Yes. If we want to achieve our best economic and social status we must become more inclusive.”</p><p>The barrier: “Lack of understanding and in some cases awareness.”</p><p><b>Sly James, mayor of Kansas City:</b> “Missouri law should protect all people from discrimination and in the decisions and circumstances that affect their lives. Neither the Bill of Rights, nor the Constitution of either the United States or the State of Missouri include the phrase ‘unless you are gay’ in the texts. Our history should be enough to remind us that discrimination comes to no good end.”</p><p>The barrier: “Political ideologies that pander to a group of citizens who, for religious or other reasons, do not see the LGBTQ community as complete and equal humans. The ideologies tend to view this segment of the electorate as a voting block to be pursued and won.”</p><p><b>Jolie Justus, Kansas City councilwoman:</b> “Yes.” </p><p>The barrier: “Leadership in the Missouri House and Senate and the Missouri Chamber of Commerce”</p><p><b>Gregg Keller, principal of Atlas Strategy Group:</b> “This is a worthwhile discussion to have as soon as, but not before, the political left settles upon a definition of gender identity that goes beyond how a given individual feels they ‘identify’ on any given day.”</p><p>The barrier: “The political left coming up with a coherent definition of the terms involved.”</p><p><b>Crosby Kemper III, director of the Kansas City Public Library, co-founder of the Show-Me Institute:</b> “As an employer in more than one field in my career, I have always been interested in hiring the best people regardless of what goes on in their private lives (if legal and not disturbing to the institutions’ customers or colleagues). I would resist adding special classes of protection beyond all the already powerful anti-discrimination laws. That said I’m open to evidence that such discrimination is a serious problem which needs legal redress.”</p><p><span>The barrier: “See above.”</span></p><p><b>Jennifer Lowry, chief toxicologist at Children’s Mercy Hospital:</b> “Absolutely! It is unfathomable to me that in 2018 we continue to have this conversation. All people deserve to work. All people deserve to have a home. All people deserve to walk into a business and be treated the same as any other person. Sex and gender of an individual is not a public discussion. It is personal to that individual and should not be judged by others. Those businesses who have employment opportunities should hire a person based on their ability to perform the job. Those who have housing to rent or sell should be proud that any person wants to live in that home. Those who have businesses that want to make a living should be happy to sell their product to those who want to enter their establishment. If we agree that sex and gender are protected, then so should the community that wears it proudly.”<br/><br/></p><p><span>The barrier: “The largest barrier to extending protections to the LGBTQ community are those who use religion to justify actions against those that make them uncomfortable. However, our constitution requires the separation of church and state and, thus, religion cannot be used as a basis for establishing law. Most importantly, however, most religious teachings, if the constitution allowed it to be considered, would promote kindness and love over hate and fear.”</span></p><p><b>Quinton Lucas, Kansas City Council member:</b> “<span>It’s unconscionable that Missouri law does not already protect LGBTQ persons from discrimination at work, in housing, and in private business. We should join the rest of the country and give our citizens all rights.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Bigotry remains our biggest barrier to extending rights to all persons.”</span></p><p><b>Dianne Lynch, president of Stephens College:</b> “Missouri needs the most talented, innovative and committed workforce it can attract and retain if it’s going to be competitive. That means it needs to be as inclusive and respectful of individual and privacy rights as the markets with which it is competing for talent. This isn’t a personal values question; it’s a business decision. So the answer in the best interests of all Missourians is: Yes. Absolutely. Without a doubt.”</p><p>The barrier: “There’s a blurring of the lines between personal values and beliefs, and economic analyses about what is likely to best serve all Missourians. Our leaders can respect the personal beliefs of all constituents and still support legislation that expands the state’s talent pool, markets and partnerships with those who don’t share those beliefs.”</p><p><b>Christopher Maples, interim chancellor of the Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology:</b> “Missouri state law should protect LGBTQ people from discrimination at work, in housing decisions, and at private businesses.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “The biggest barrier to Missouri extending protections to LGBTQ people may be the reticence of elected officials to introduce legislation that may be viewed as being in opposition to religious views held by some of their constituents.”</p><p><b>Richard Martin, director of governmental affairs at JE Dunn Construction:</b> “If there is not current law that protects the LGBTQ community from discrimination in housing, employment and their freedom to pursue economic opportunities without obstacles based on their sexual identity. Then yes.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Perhaps it’s in the state’s DNA to be more like a follower than a leader on progressive social issues.”</p><p><b>Jay Nixon, former governor:</b> “<span>Absolutely. Our state must lead on vital civil rights issues, and be a welcoming place to work and live.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “The major business interests and groups must prioritize this as ‘workforce’ development.”</span></p><p><b>Ken Novak, UMKC professor of criminal justice and criminology:</b> “State law should protect the LGBTQ community from discriminatory practices at work and other forums. LGBTQ is a protected class and citizens should expect the same legal protection from discriminatory behavior as gender, race, ethnicity, age, veteran status, etc. But beyond the legal implications — it’s just the right thing to do. That should be sufficient justification alone.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Like many protected classes the LGBTQ community comprises a small portion of the population — clearly the minority. Legislators, as well as citizens, likely have less familiarity with people in this community or the unique barriers they face, and, as such, (don’t prioritize) safeguards to mitigate discriminatory practices. Protection may be triaged as a lower priority (if it is a priority at all).”</p><p><b>CiCi Rojas, partner and president of Tico Productions and Tico Sports:</b> “In general, yes.” </p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">The barrier: “Businesses or organizations who may have religious or bias that prohibit them.”</p><p><b>Leland Shurin, attorney, vice president Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners:</b> “Absolutely. I am amazed, disappointed and angered that it would still be a question/issue in Missouri at this time.”</p><p>The barrier: “The use by so many politicians of unreasonable fear as a political wedge issue and the erroneous interpretation of religious principles.”</p><p><b>Ryan Silvey, Missouri Public Service commissioner, former state senator: </b>“<span>Yes”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “There is a philosophical concern by several in the legislature with creating additional protected classes for any reason.”</span></p><p><b>Jeff Simon, managing partner, Husch Blackwell:</b> “Yes.” </p><p><span>The barrier: “A philosophical concern about over-regulation by government, combined with a lingering prejudice against gays among some.”</span></p><p><b>Phil Snowden, member of University of Missouri Board of Curators: </b>“<span>Yes. Yes. We’re all people and all in this together. We should have equal rights.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “Sometimes movements take shape and the right course of action doesn’t evolve for years. This may not be the hottest issue to push in Missouri but the state is headed in the right direction.”</span></p><p><b>David Steelman, attorney, former state legislator, chairman of the University of Missouri Board of Curators:</b> “Yes.” </p><p>The barrier: “All reasonable people should agree that discrimination is wrong and should be discouraged. However, the details of the remedy are always more important than is realized. It is important the legislation not be unduly restrictive of religious freedom or freedom of association.”</p><p><b>Maurice Watson, partner at Husch Blackwell law firm: </b>“<span>Protections in Missouri are needed and overdue.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: “There’s hope in the tolerant attitudes of younger people who are now of voting age.”</span></p><p><b>Pam Whiting, vice president for communications, Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce:</b> “<span>Absolutely.”</span></p><p><span>The barrier: While attitudes and understanding continue to evolve, we still have a long way to go. SJR 39 came close to passage two years ago, but was narrowly defeated, which gives me hope, though similar bills have been introduced in the legislature the past two years. Thankfully, they didn’t go anywhere.</span></p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>For at least two decades, lawmakers in the <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article199081469.html\" target=\"_blank\">Missouri General Assembly have passed the baton</a> on gay rights.</p><p>But in 2019, those supporting legal protections for the LGBTQ community hope to cross something of a finish line.</p><p>Next year is when some expect to see passage of proposals floated every session since 1998 to include sexual orientation among societal classes protected from discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations. The effort has gone by the moniker MONA — the Missouri Nondiscrimination Act.</p><p>A consensus is building, no doubt: On the general point of gay, lesbian or transgender persons needing legal cover from losing jobs or potential homes on the sole basis of their sexual selves, The Kansas City Star’s panel of business leaders, policymakers, community catalysts and opinion shapers —<a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/influencers/\" target=\"_blank\"> “The Missouri Influencers” —</a> speak almost in a singular voice:</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>“Absolutely!” on the necessity for LGBTQ protections, said Jennifer Lowry, chief toxicologist at Children’s Mercy Hospital. “It is unfathomable to me that in 2018 we continue to have this conversation.”</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>“Absolutely,” echoed Pam Whiting, vice president for communications for the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>“An emphatic ‘YES’” to MONA, wrote former Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes, now at Park University, in response to a brief survey to Influencers on the issue.</p><p>But ask about the details: How exactly do we get there — ensuring that civil rights are equal between those LGBTQ and those not, in all matters public or private? Then some opinions waiver.</p><p>The Missouri Influencer Series brings together readers of The Star and 51 high-profile Missourians for conversations about the most pressing matters confronting the state. Asked about LGBTQ issues, readers in an online survey rated as their top question whether the state should extend legal protections to LGBTQ people at work, in housing decisions and in private businesses.</p><p>Of more than <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article218408650.html#storylink=mainstage\" target=\"_blank\">30 Influencers who weighed in on that question</a>, many allowed that difficult but realistic challenges stir in the details. </p><p>Who prevails, for example, when someone’s sexual orientation clashes with the biblical beliefs of a faith-based employer or adoption agency, wedding planner, university or service providers to the aged?</p><p>Or, how should society settle tensions that arise when schools provide special restroom privileges for pupils transitioning to the gender with which they identify?</p><p>That riddle is now being weighed by the Missouri Supreme Court, which could rule by Election Day on <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article209799884.html\" target=\"_blank\">a locker room dispute in the Blue Springs School District.</a></p><p>The primary beachheads in Missouri and much of the nation are courtrooms considering, case by case, matters pitting religious liberties, personal privacy and the meaning of equal protection. </p><p>In a yet another case being mulled by the Missouri Supreme Court, a gay man working for the state Department of Social Services said he was treated poorly because he lacked “stereotypical attributes of how a male should appear and behave.” Missouri’s Human Rights Commission rejected his case after ruling that the worker was claiming discrimination on sexual orientation rather than on his sex, or gender, and thus he was not in a protected class under state law. </p><p>An appeals court ruled in the man’s favor and the state appealed.</p><p>“There are still many people not there with us,” said Kansas City Councilwoman Jolie Justus.</p><p>She was the first openly gay person to win a state Senate seat 12 years ago. </p><p>Despite enormous strides in LGBTQ acceptance since then, Justus said, Missourians in many communities can still be fired for setting on their office desk a portrait of a same-sex spouse.</p><h3>Equal protection</h3><p>Sharpest on the radar of gay-rights issues in Missouri is potential passage of a bill that would protect what groups increasingly call “LGBTQ” persons from discrimination in employment and housing.</p><p>(Just this summer the St. Louis-based advocacy group<a href=\"https://promoonline.org/news/we-are-adding-the-q/\" target=\"_blank\"> PROMO added to the LGBT designation the letter “Q”</a> , for queer, signifying a proud stance of many in the movement, especially millennials, to project more inclusive lifestyles over specific categories of sexuality.)</p><p>Regarding job discrimination, push-back groups include the Associated Industries of Missouri, representing hundreds of companies. Ray McCarty, the group’s president and CEO, told The Star, “We oppose legislation that sets up new ways of suing employers.”</p><p>The concern over creating grounds for too many lawsuits is expressed by some Kansas City area Influencers, as well. </p><p>“I would resist adding special classes of protection beyond the already powerful anti-discrimination laws,” said Crosby Kemper III, director of the Kansas City Public Library. “That said, I’m open to evidence that such discrimination is a serious problem which needs legal redress.”</p><p>Missouri House Rep. Greg Razer, a Kansas City Democrat, is trying. He said he and a Republican colleague — the only openly gay members of the legislature — are encountering growing support from legislators to approve LGBTQ protections after 20 years of dodging the Missouri Nondiscrimination Act.</p><p>In May, Razer’s bill <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article211342324.html\" target=\"_blank\">won 6-0 approval from a state legislative committee</a> — just the second time a committee cleared a MONA measure since the movement took off. “That’s as far as we got,” Razer said. “And sadly, that was a victory.”</p><p>But he expressed confidence that anti-discrimination forces finally have enough backing from Missouri lawmakers — including many older Republicans once opposed — that a resubmitted bill may quickly become law after legislators convene in January.</p><p>“I feel like at any moment the floodgate on this issue is going to open,” Razer said. </p><p>He noted that <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article212688674.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, voted as a state senator</a> in 2013 for one version of the Missouri Nondiscrimination Act. </p><p>No such measure became law this year, as legislative leaders who have come around on MONA were cautious not to rile conservative voter bases in 2018 elections. But Razer said that he has heard enough support from both sides of the political aisle that passage is closer than ever before.</p><p>John Hancock, a political consultant who for many years headed the Missouri GOP, agreed.</p><p>With conditions.</p><p>“If it’s written narrowly enough” so as not to impose on the rights on faith-based employers who might “object out of conscience,” then many conservatives will support the legislation, Hancock said.</p><p> “As a matter of general principle,” he added, “nobody should be for discrimination.”</p><p>Kansas City, Jackson and St. Louis counties and a dozen other Missouri cities have local ordinances that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. But for LGBTQ persons facing unfair treatment at work or in obtaining housing, “to use just a city law to get the protections they need isn’t enough,” Justus said. </p><p>She said it’s time for the state to extend protections it has long carved into law for classes of race, age, religion, sex and the disabled. </p><h3>Schools and gender ID</h3><p>On another front, Missouri public school districts are quickly confronting, one by one, a push in some communities for “gender-neutral” bathrooms.</p><p>When classes opened last month in the North Kansas City School District, students and parents seemed to welcome fully enclosed <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article216439305.html\" target=\"_self\">single-occupancy stalls</a> at two new grade schools, two sixth-grade centers and North Kansas City High School. Signage on the rooms feature male and female figures, providing private and more comfortable accommodations for students regardless of their gender identity, school officials told The Star.</p><p>In Blue Springs, a legal showdown ensued in 2016 when school administrators denied a transgender student’s request to use male locker room facilities. </p><p>Attorneys for the teen — identified as “RMA” in court documents — argue the pupil was discriminated against on sex-based grounds, a violation of the Missouri Human Rights Act. The school district counters that the law’s definition of “sex” doesn’t apply to RMA’s request. </p><p>A Jackson County judge and the Missouri Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the district. A state supreme court decision is expected in the fall.</p><p>Across Missouri, “we’ve had school districts quietly working with transgender students for a while, and nobody’s even noticed,” said Kelli Hopkins, associate executive director for the Missouri School Board Association. “Most district don’t draw a line until it comes to locker rooms and bathrooms.</p><p>“As cases are going up through the courts, you’re getting different results...We recommend that (schools) do whatever you can to accommodate all students.”</p><p>Transgender accommodations, in schools and the workplace, will continue to evolve, said attorney Maurice Watson, who heads a diversity and inclusion committee at the Husch Blackwell law firm.</p><p>Watson, an Influencer, said he has sat in meetings with local corporations attended by prominent transgender employees young and old.</p><p>“They may not be on the corporate board, but these are people in visible positions at their firms,” Watson said. “They are present and they are proud.” <br/><br/></p><h3>Religious freedoms</h3><p>Many of The Star’s Influencers referenced a need to respect religious freedoms while affirming LGBTQ rights and legal protections.</p><p>Former U.S. Sen. Jack Danforth: “I think that people should be protected from discrimination based on sexual orientation, except I think that the law should allow for businesses and organizations to practice their religious beliefs when their religion does not recognize same-sex marriage.”</p><p>Former state legislator David Steelman, chairman of the University of Missouri Board of Curators: “All reasonable people should agree that discrimination is wrong and should be discouraged. </p><p>“However, the details of the remedy are always more important than is realized. It is important the legislation not be unduly restrictive of religious freedom or freedom of association.”</p><p>Lawyer and radio host Jane Dueker questioned whether the statehouse ever will agree on a resolution: “Similar to gay marriage, I think the legislature will punt and force the courts to do the right thing then say, ‘it is settled.’”</p><p>Wouldn’t be a first for Jefferson City. </p><p>“Perhaps it’s in the state’s DNA,” said Influencer Richard Martin, of JE Dunn Construction, “to be more like a follower than a leader on progressive issues.”</p><p><span><br/><br/></span></p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\">The Star’s Allison Kite contributed this report.</div><p>Previous survey: <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article217982680.html\" target=\"_blank\">Organized labor</a></p><p>Next survey: Minimum wage</p><h3>We want to hear from you</h3><p>Initiative petitions have put minimum wage hikes on ballots across the country in recent years, and this year, Missourians will vote this fall on whether to raise the minimum rate to $12 per hour.

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Missouri is 3-0 after a last-second win over Purdue but the Tigers go into Saturday’s game against No. 2 Georgia with a lot of problems to fix, mainly on defense. The last time Georgia visited, Missouri blew a late lead and lost on a fourth-down play. A win would propel Drew Lock’s Heisman status, and likely get the Tigers ranked and start contract extension talks for Barry Odom. </p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">The details</h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Kickoff:</b> 11 a.m. Saturday</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Where:</b> Memorial Stadium, Columbia</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>TV:</b> ESPN</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Radio:</b> KMBZ (98.1 FM)</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>The line:</b> Georgia by 16 1/2</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><!-- %asset:217586570% --></p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Five things to know</h3><ol><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Missouri’s offense</b> matched up well against Georgia last season: The Tigers’ 28 points against the Bulldogs were the second-most a team scored on them in the regular season and third most behind Oklahoma and Auburn. While Missouri lost 53-28 in Athens last year, the game was close in the first half.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>And you thought</b> Missouri’s D-line was struggling? Georgia ranks dead last among FBS teams in sacks, with just one. Missouri’s offensive line has done a good job protecting Drew Lock through three games, that should continue.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>This is an interesting game for </b>Derek Dooley: He got his start in coaching as a defensive graduate assistant at Georgia, when coach Kirby Smart was still a player. They go way back. And Dooley’s son J.T. is a walk-on receiver for the Bulldogs. Will Smart put him in the game if the score dictates it?</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>The Tigers’ secondary</b> is a mess: Missouri ranks No. 118 in passing defense. Cornerback DeMarkus Acy went out after the first play at Purdue because of “somewhat of a concussion,” Odom said, and his status for Saturday is unknown. The Tigers missed Acy greatly and can’t afford a repeat performance.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>The stadium should be</b> electric: Missouri AD Jim Sterk told reporters that the Georgia game was close to a sellout before the Purdue game went final. Memorial Stadium should be sold out by Saturday for the first time since the 2014 season finale against Arkansas.</p></li></ol><p dir=\"ltr\"><!-- %asset:217344820% --></p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Kansas football has broken through barriers the last two weeks, and there’s even more new ground to reach if the Jayhawks are able to defeat Baylor in a 2:30 p.m. road game on Saturday.</p><p>In winning at Central Michigan, <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-kansas/article218062145.html\" target=\"_blank\">KU was able to snap an FBS-record 46-game road losing streak</a>. Then, in last week’s blowout win over Rutgers, <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-kansas/article218460905.html\" target=\"_blank\">the Jayhawks picked up their first consecutive victories since the 2011 season</a>.</p><p>KU has not won a Big 12 road game since Oct. 4, 2009, and a victory also would give KU three wins in four games. That might not seem like much, but — if it happened — it would tie the highest win total of any Jayhawks team in any of the last nine seasons ... with eight games on the schedule still remaining. </p><h3 style=\"font-size: 1.71429em;\">The details</h3><p><b>Kickoff:</b> 2:30 p.m. Saturday</p><p><b>Where:</b> McLane Stadium, Waco, Texas</p><p><b>TV: </b>FS1</p><p><b>Radio:</b> WHB (810 AM) in Kansas City, KFH (1240 AM) in Wichita</p><p><b>The line:</b> Baylor by 9 1/2</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><h3 style=\"font-size: 1.71429em;\">Five things to know</h3><ol><li><b>Pooka is for real.</b> True freshman running back Pooka Williams, <a href=\"https://t.co/5pJqI2AAdz\" target=\"_blank\">who rushed for 158 yards against Rutgers</a>, is starting to get national attention. Not only was he one of two running backs on Pro Football Focus’ All-Offense team this week, but through three weeks, the site has him <a href=\"https://t.co/5pJqI2AAdz\" target=\"_blank\">graded as the No. 1 running back in the nation</a>.</li><li><b>KU has turned around its turnovers.</b> The Jayhawks’ plus-12 turnover differential this season ranks first nationally. Remember, KU finished at minus-17 a year ago.</li><li><b>Baylor has owned the recent matchups.</b> In Beaty’s three previous seasons, he’s lost to Baylor and 66-7, 49-7 and 38-9. The Bears have also outscored the Jayhawks, 205-42, during the teams’ last four games in Waco.</li><li><b>The Bears’ offense has been ahead of their defense this year.</b> Baylor is 32nd in offense and 98th in defense <a href=\"https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/ncaa\" target=\"_blank\">according to Bill Connelly’s advanced S&amp;P+ rankings</a>. The Bears’ strength is their passing game, as they’ve averaged 8.9 yards per attempt (tied for 30th nationally) while racking up 19, 20-plus-yard passing plays (tied for fourth).</li><li><b>Is there a chance? </b>KU is only a 9 1/2-point underdog, which is even more amazing considering recent history. According to the database at OddsShark, KU has been a single-digit road underdog in a Big 12 game <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessenewell/status/1041721603808210947\" target=\"_blank\">only one time in its previous 30 outings</a>. That was at Iowa State on Nov. 23, 2013 (four-point underdog) in a contest KU lost 34-0.</li></ol><p> <!-- %asset:217344790% --> </p></div>",

We’re about to find out. </p><p>This will not be an easy opener. The Wildcats (2-1) head to Morgantown as 14 1/2-point underdogs against the No. 12 Mountaineers (2-0). But <a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/sports/college/big-12/kansas-state/article218407150.html\" target=\"_blank\">they did get a confidence boost over the weekend from a 41-17 victory over Texas-San Antonio</a>, while West Virginia players sat at home following the cancellation of their game against North Carolina State because of Hurricane Florence.</p><h3 style=\"font-size: 1.71429em;\">The details</h3><p><b>Kickoff:</b> 2:30 p.m. Saturday</p><p><b>Where:</b> Milan Puskar Stadium, Morgantown, W.Va.</p><p><b>TV:</b> ESPN</p><p><b>Radio:</b> KQAM (1480 AM) in Wichita, KCSP (610 AM) in Kansas City</p><p><b>The line:</b> West Virginia by 14 1/2</p><p><!-- %asset:217586570% --></p><h3 style=\"font-size: 1.71429em;\">Five things to know</h3><ol><li><b>The Mountaineers have one of the nation’s most explosive offenses.</b> With Heisman Trophy contender Will Grier at quarterback and dynamic playmakers Gary Jennings and David Sills at receiver, it’s difficult for any defense to slow this passing attack. West Virginia flexed its offensive muscles in its first two games, routing Tennessee 40-14 and Youngstown State 52-17. WVU is averaging 586 yards per game.</li><li><b>This is Dana Holgorsen’s most complete team</b> of his eight-year tenure with the Mountaineers. Not only is this West Virginia group loaded on offense, it is also playing solid defense, allowing 297 yards per game. </li><li><b>West Virginia has had K-State’s number in recent years.</b> K-State won its first five games against West Virginia when the Mountaineers joined the Big 12 in 2012, but the Wildcats haven’t had any luck the past two years. West Virginia won both, including 28-23 last year in Manhattan. </li><li><b>This could be K-State’s most difficult game of the season.</b> The Wildcats have already played No. 14 Mississippi State and must later take on No. 5 Oklahoma, but West Virginia could be every bit as challenging. The Mountaineers 3-4 defense and high-flying offense are always difficult to prepare for.</li><li><b>K-State may be short handed again on defense. </b>Starting safety Denzel Goolsby isn’t expected to return from injury anytime soon. Defensive back Kevion McGee has missed two straight games because of an injury. And Linebacker Elijah Sullivan remains questionable after missing the UTSA game. The Wildcats will need players like Eli Walker and Sam Sivelove to step up on defense against a formidable opponent.</li></ol></div>",

Tyreek Hill returned the kick against the Chargers 91 yards for a touchdown, and De’Anthony Thomas returned his 48 yards to set up a short-field score against the Steelers. No one’s postgame smile in the first two weeks has been bigger than special teams coach Dave Toub.</p><h3>Sack opportunity?</h3><p>The Chiefs got one against the Steelers when Allen Bailey got his arms around Ben Roelisthberger. That’s a week after Dee Ford got the team’s lone sack against the Chargers. Could this week be the game the defense steps up in a bigger way? In the 49ers’ 30-27 victory over the Lions on Sunday, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was sacked six times and has been taken down nine times this season.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217344615% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Three high-profile commitments with two months to go until the November signing period is a pretty good spot for John Calipari to be in, and his early recruiting haul received more accolades last week with Rivals.com’s latest update to its <a href=\"https://n.rivals.com/prospect_rankings/rivals150/2019\">class of 2019 rankings</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The biggest mover among players ranked in the top 20 was <a href=\"https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2019/kahlil-whitney-171026\">Kahlil Whitney</a>, who committed to Kentucky last month and jumped from No. 23 to No. 7 on Rivals’ list.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The only other committed player in the new top 10 was <a href=\"https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2019/tyrese-maxey-171839\">Tyrese Maxey</a>, the affable point guard from Texas who committed to the Cats back in May and is the No. 9 player in the country.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And the highest-ranked high school player from Kentucky? That would be Pendleton County’s <a href=\"https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2019/dontaie-allen-225600\">Dontaie Allen</a>, who picked UK in early August and is ranked No. 54 nationally by Rivals.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“It’s the start of what you expect from John Calipari and Kentucky in recruiting,” Rivals.com national analyst Eric Bossi told the Herald-Leader. “They’re off to a great start.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Bossi added that he expects Kentucky to land “two or three more big-time guys” in the 2019 cycle and contend for the honor of No. 1 recruiting class in the country yet again. Calipari visited five of the six top-ranked prospects in the new Rivals rankings — Vernon Carey, James Wiseman, Jaden McDaniels, Isaiah Stewart and Matthew Hurt — <a href=\"https://www.kentucky.com/sports/college/kentucky-sports/uk-recruiting/article218514525.html\">over the past week alone</a>, and several other highly touted players remain on his 2019 wish list.</p><p> <!-- %asset:218348885% --> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Cats’ recruiting haul so far is <a href=\"https://basketballrecruiting.rivals.com/news/rivals-rankings-week-five-programs-that-should-be-pleased-2\">good enough for the No. 2 national ranking</a> — behind Southern Cal — and it’s a group led by Whitney, an athletic wing player from Chicago who was measured at 6-7.5 with a 6-10.5 wingspan at last month’s Nike Skills Academy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Such drastic moves — from No. 23 to No. 7 — are not often seen within the five-star ranking zone, but Whitney has had an especially impressive year so far.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I don’t think anyone has ever disputed how talented he was. But he hasn’t always been in the situation to be the man,” Bossi said. “This spring and summer was really the first time where he was clear cut with the opportunity to be the man, and we really liked what we saw from him in the spring. We toyed with maybe moving him into the top 15 after the spring, but we just kind of wanted that one more summer of, ‘OK, let’s watch and be sure that this is really what we think of him.’ And he was even better during July.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“A lot of kids talk about getting serious in the gym and putting in the time and committing to their craft, but you can see once they hit the floor who is really about that life and who isn’t. And Kahlil has clearly been about that. His jump shot is much improved. His ball handling is much improved. A consistent motor and effort and trying to step on people’s throats — that’s him now. And that hasn’t always been the case.”</p><p>Whitney, who plays for Roselle Catholic (N.J.), the alma mater of former UK player Isaiah Briscoe, has acknowledged past issues with not sustaining his energy on the court. He showed over the summer that motor is no longer a problem, and analysts have taken notice.<a href=\"https://247sports.com/Season/2019-Basketball/RecruitRankings/?InstitutionGroup=HighSchool\"> 247Sports ranks him No. 6 nationally</a>, and<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/playerrankings/_/view/espnu100/sort/rank/class/2019\"> ESPN has him at No. 9</a>.<br/><br/></p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I think he has to be looked at as a legitimate one-and-done candidate at this point,” Bossi said. “What happens in college and over the next year of high school will obviously play into that. He’s reached this point. Now he can’t settle and feel like he’s made it. He probably needs to work even harder than he’s worked to get to where he is. But that potential is certainly there, and he does look to me now like a guy who isn’t just going to be a good college player. He’s going to be a guy who can come in and make an immediate and big impact right away as a freshman.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Maxey and Allen are obviously important additions, too, and Rivals.com national analyst Corey Evans says the versatility of this initial trio should give Kentucky several options — both on the court and in the way the Cats finish out the 2019 recruiting cycle. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“They have the top in-state prospect — and one of the best isolation scorers on the wing — with Dontaie Allen,” Evans told the Herald-Leader. “They have maybe the biggest alpha dog of them all with Kahlil Whitney. And they have the biggest personality with Tyrese Maxey. So it’s not a bland class whatsoever. It checks a lot of the boxes when it comes to energy, scoring, shooting, defense, toughness.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I think it just gives Calipari and his staff a lot of wiggle room going into the fall, as far as what they need or what they want. Because guys like Maxey and Whitney, they can mask so many other holes that might be there.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:212444894% --> </p><p> <!-- %asset:215716970% --> </p></div>",

              "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Writers at the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and others wrote or talked about how Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes had had an incredible start to the 2018 season.</p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ amazing start to the season — 10 touchdowns, no interceptions — has helped the Chiefs to a pair of big road wins over the Chargers and Steelers.</p><p>It’s got Chiefs fans buzzing, and here’s the thing, members of the national media are also gushing over Mahomes. The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and Yahoo Sports all had stories about Mahomes’ quick start. I’ve included a snippet of what each person wrote and you can click the link to read the full stories, although some may require a paid subscription.</p><p>Here is what people are saying.</p><p>Adam Kilgore of the Washington Post wrote a story with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/09/16/the-nfl-belongs-to-patrick-mahomes-now/?utm_term=.3adf1cd21600\">“The NFL belongs to Patrick Mahomes now.”</a></p><p>“His physical ability and phenomenal performances fail to encapsulate Mahomes’s place in the league,” Kilgore wrote. “He’s too physically gifted to be seen as a prototype — good luck finding the next mobile, 6-foot-3 quarterback who can throw it 70 yards in the air. But Mahomes — a collegiate product of the ‘Air Raid’ offense, a starting quarterback on his rookie deal, a triggerman for Andy Reid’s designs and a conductor of concepts taken from college football — is something close to an ideal of modern NFL quarterback. He fits into every way the league is leaning.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Reid’s schemes have become the model for how offense is played. Seven NFL head coaches once coached under Reid, including reigning Super Bowl winner Doug Pederson and the Chicago Bears’s Matt Nagy, whose creative play-calling would have been the talk of the league if not for Aaron Rodgers’s heroics last Sunday night in Green Bay’s comeback victory. Mahomes’s talent may have made him a star in any setting, but he landed with perhaps the best developer of quarterbacks and most influential offensive mind in the game.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kilgore concludes with this:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“And so Sunday may have only been a start for Mahomes. He will face stiffer challenges than Pittsburgh’s secondary, to be sure, and not every Sunday will feel like a glimpse into a fluorescent future of the sport. But through two weeks, Mahomes hasn’t only been the most impressive player in the league. He’s been a signpost of where the sport is headed.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Andrew Beaton of the Wall Street Journal wrote a story with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/patrick-mahomes-is-conquering-the-nfl-1537136770?mod=e2tws\">“Patrick Mahomes is conquering the NFL.”</a></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Beaton opened the piece by writing about the risk the Chiefs took in trading away Alex Smith, who had a great season, and making the unproven Mahomes the starter.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Two weeks into this season, it’s no longer reasonable to question if Mahomes is good, and it’s far more reasonable to ponder if Mahomes is great,” Beaton wrote. “That much was clear after his second consecutive monster game. He threw for six touchdowns in a 42-37 win against the Steelers—giving him 10 through the season’s first two weeks.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes, 22 years old, is now the youngest player in the Super Bowl era with a six-touchdown passing game. His 10 throwing scores are a record for the first two weeks of the season. But his eye-popping statistics, somehow, aren’t even the most jarring aspect of what he has done so far. That’s because somehow what he has done is less notable than how he has done it. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes has dazzled with heaves uncommon in the modern NFL, which has increasingly shifted toward favoring high-probability short passes over riskier and longer ones. Mahomes has taken that trend and blasted it to smithereens with the bazooka attached to the right side of his torso.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yahoo Sports’ Terez Paylor, the former Kansas City Star writer, had a column with the headline, <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/legend-patrick-mahomes-grows-chiefs-appear-found-qb-savior-013002515.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The legend of Patrick Mahomes grows as the Chiefs appear to have found their QB savior.”</a></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Paylor mentioned the Chiefs’ past troubles against the Steelers and why Sunday’s win meant that much more in Kansas City.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes has shown it all in wins against the Steelers and Chargers, including a rifle arm, moxie and the ability to throw under duress and from different platforms. The Chiefs needed every last drop of his talent to come out with the win on Sunday, as Mahomes managed to outduel (Ben) Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh’s future Hall of Famer, who completed 39 of 60 passes for 452 yards and three touchdowns.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes’ numbers already look ridiculous on the surface, but his performance is even more impressive when you consider it came against a Steelers team whose reliance on a fire zone pressure – where five defenders rush the passer and while the others (including defensive linemen) drop into coverage — has vexed the Chiefs in all of their previous five meetings under Reid.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Paylor later added: “Time after time against the Steelers, Mahomes’ ability to keep his eyes up under pressure, scan the pocket and deliver lasers from different platforms and launch points made the difference. The Steelers even became so weary of seeing Mahomes defeat their blitz packages that by the end of the game, they’d started dialing back on the blitzing in lieu of dropping more men into coverage.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Do not underestimate the importance of this. It is the ultimate show of respect, one reserved almost solely for quarterbacks like Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady, guys who can use their brains and rocket arms to destroy the zone blitzes that naturally leave defenses thin on players in actual coverages.”</p><p>Finally, it should come as no surprise that Peter Schrager, who is on “Good Morning Football” on the NFL Network, was wowed by Mahomes on Sunday:</p><p> <!-- %asset:218530770% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">A prediction: Arrowhead Stadium is going to be loud on Sunday. Really loud.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The unbeaten Chiefs will make their 2018 home debut Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers, and it will be the first home start of quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ career. Kickoff is at noon and the game is on WDAF (Ch. 4).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Having knocked off the preseason AFC West favorite Chargers and long-time nemesis Pittsburgh, both on the road, the Chiefs are likely to be fired up for the game, too.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In fact, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickMahomes5/status/1041445889510920194\">Mahomes tweeted</a> after Sunday’s win over the Steelers: “We are just getting started..! We are coming home #ChiefsKindom”</p><p>I’m providing a quick overview of the next Chiefs’ opponent early in each week, and here are five things to know about the 49ers, 1-1.</p><p> <!-- %asset:218539425% --> </p><h3>Jimmy G</h3><p>The 49ers were a preseason darling thanks to quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo’s strong finish to the 2017 season after being traded from New England to San Francisco. The Niners won their last five games and many expected they’d make the postseason behind Garoppolo.</p><p>But in the 49ers’ opener, Garoppolo threw three interceptions in a loss at Minnesota. On Sunday, San Francisco beat the Lions 30-27 but Garoppolo dodged a bullet. Nursing that three-point lead late in the game, the Lions’ Tracy Walker intercepted a pass that was returned to the San Francisco 7. Garoppolo was bailed out by a defensive holding call on the other side of the field.</p><p>Garoppolo has completed 33 of 59 passes for 467 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions this season.</p><h3>Meet Matt Breida</h3><p>San Francisco running back Matt Breida rushed for 138 yards against the Lions and broke off a 66-yard touchdown scamper that was the 49ers’ longest TD run in four seasons. A big block aided Breida:</p><p><!-- %asset:218528265% --></p><p>Breida, who is in his second season after signing as an undrafted free agent out of Georgia Southern, has 22 rushing attempts this season for 184 yards. Former Washington running back Alfred Morris has 86 yards rushing in 26 attempts.</p><h3>Red Zone troubles</h3><p>The 49ers made five trips to the red zone against the Lions but had to settle for a field goal three times. Garoppolo was sacked three times on those three drives that ended in field goals.</p><p>Against the Vikings in the opener, San Francisco got to the red zone four times. Here is what happened:</p><p>1. Morris fumbled at the 1</p><p>2. Settled for a 33-yard field goal</p><p>3. Scored a touchdown</p><p>4. Had to kick a 22-yard field goal.</p><p>So that’s nine trips to the red zone and just three touchdowns scored this season for the Niners.</p><h3>Richard Sherman</h3><p>The 49ers signed cornerback Richard Sherman this summer. He was a four-time Pro Bowler, a first-team All-Pro three times and won a Super Bowl with the Seattle Seahawks before coming to San Francisco.</p><p>Sherman made two tackles Sunday against the Lions and recovered a fumble in the 49ers’ season opener at Minnesota.</p><p>Heading into Monday night’s game, the 49ers rank 23rd in pass defense (278 yards per game) and are tied for the fourth-most touchdown passes allowed. Two of the top three are teams the Chiefs have played: Pittsburgh at No. 1 and the Chargers are tied for second with the Bills.</p><h3>A new receiver?</h3><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1041328126813458432\" target=\"_blank\">ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported</a> that the Cleveland Browns are expected to trade wide receiver Josh Gordon and hope to send him to a team in the NFC.</p><p>Gordon can’t dictate where the Browns will trade him, but he would like to go to Dallas or San Francisco, Schefter reported.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/49ers/article/John-Lynch-49ers-have-called-about-Browns-WR-13233684.php\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco Chronicle reported</a> that 49ers general manager John Lynch has contacted the Browns about Gordon.</p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>The preparation commenced last fall, as Patrick Mahomes sat in the same quarterbacks room with Alex Smith day after day. It accelerated over training camp this summer, after Mahomes had assumed the starting job in Kansas City. He took dozens of snaps in practice, rolled with the first team in three preseason games and received significant attention from offensive-minded coaches.</p><p>But no matter the amount of time or facets allocated toward Mahomes’ development, there were aspects of it that remained unknown until the real games arrived.</p><p>His response to pressure in the pocket. His response to a defense that disguised and diversified its looks.</p><p>So far, so good. A day after Mahomes tied a franchise record with six touchdowns in the 42-37 win in Pittsburgh, Chiefs coach Andy Reid started there.</p><p> <!-- %asset:218539425% --> </p><p>“The thing that I think gets overlooked in this one is they threw a bunch at him,” Reid said Monday of the Steelers’ defense. “Which I thought was going to be an important thing for him to work with.”</p><p>The film room identifies the coverages and the sources of potential blitzes and pressures. The Chiefs spent considerable time helping<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>Mahomes distinguish them.</p><p>But he doesn’t get hit in practice. The risk of standing in the pocket isn’t elevated in the same manner it is during a game.</p><p>Reid said Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Keith Butler “threw the kitchen sink” at the Chiefs with different pressures. To be sure, the offensive line deserves a major share of the credit for that being a non-factor, which Reid, Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce were quick to point out.</p><p>But Mahomes earned his share, too. Rather than scrambling and breaking the plan of a play, he manipulated the pocket.</p><p>“For a young guy, you wanna see how he handles the blitz and/or any pressure (and) how he settles in the pocket,” Reid said. “There are subtle things that can take place off of a three-technique or a one-technique. And if you’re getting a little pressure there, how do you move and still keep your eyes downfield? There are a bunch of little things in there that take place.</p><p>“Until you’re live — until you take that yellow jersey off — you’re not sure exactly. We get to see it here, (and) he seems to be doing that pretty good.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p>A couple of plays — one from each of the first two weeks — serve as a prime example.</p><p>On Sunday in Pittsburgh, Mahomes had Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt bearing down on him. The play call was actually a run-pass option, meaning Mahomes could have simply handed the ball to Kareem Hunt and avoided a hit. Instead, he faked the handoff, then fired to Tyreek Hill for first-down yardage.</p><p>It mirrored a similar sequence against the Los Angeles Chargers in the opener.</p><p>“He’s done that the last couple weeks. He’s pretty good with that,” Reid said. “There’s going to be games where he’s going to have to maneuver some things, but he’s doing that right now. And the line’s giving him enough time right now, which is an important thing for a young quarterback.”</p><p>As for the coverages, Mahomes was able to shift the secondary with his eyes. He did it on each of the touchdowns to Kelce.</p><p>His reads have been true. Well, for the most part. Moments after Reid said the amount of nuance encountering Mahomes on Sunday might have been overlooked, he finished the same thought with acknowledgment that not all of it was handled perfectly — that even after a six-touchdown day, there remains opportunity for development.</p><p>“He’s using his instincts. He’s using his guys. He’s seeing it right now,” Reid said. “He’s just gotta keep growing with that. There were some things that he could’ve done better. I don’t wanna take anything away from him, but he’s a young kid, man, and he’s learning as we go. You’re seeing it. There’s room for improvement there.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:217344670% --> </p></div>",

The proposal — <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_Amendment_1,_Lobbying,_Campaign_Finance,_and_Redistricting_Initiative_(2018)\" target=\"_blank\">Amendment 1</a> — offers several changes to the state’s constitution, all involving the state legislature.</p><p><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_Amendment_1,_Lobbying,_Campaign_Finance,_and_Redistricting_Initiative_(2018)\" target=\"_self\">The amendment</a> includes lobbying restrictions and a limit on lobbyist gifts, redistricting reform, campaign finance reform and changes to make state government more transparent. Green decided the measure contained too many different subjects, a process he called “logrolling.”</p><p> “The Court’s review of this Bunyanesque initiative leaves this Court with an abiding conviction that it is the quintessential logroll,” Green wrote. </p><p>His ruling leaves us with an abiding conviction that he removed the measure from the ballot for partisan reasons.</p><p><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Daniel_Green\" target=\"_self\">Judge Green is a Republican</a>. The plaintiffs’ <a href=\"https://www.abc17news.com/news/appeal-filed-after-clean-missouri-amendment-removed-from-nov-ballot/795134754\" target=\"_self\">case was argued</a> by <a href=\"https://www.gravesgarrett.com/member/edward-d-greim/\" target=\"_self\">Edward Greim</a>, who is the law partner of Todd Graves, the <a href=\"https://gop.com/leaders/state-chairman-todd-graves-mo/\" target=\"_self\">chairman of the Missouri Republican Party</a>. Other <a href=\"https://www.semissourian.com/story/2546369.html\" target=\"_self\">Republican lawmakers have opposed</a> the Clean Missouri proposal.</p><p>It isn’t clear why the GOP is so resistant to needed ethics reforms in Jefferson City or why the party is so afraid of letting the people decide this issue. Limits on lobbying and drawing legislative districts more fairly should be supported by every Missourian who wants open, honest government.</p><p>It’s true that Democrats are involved in the Clean Missouri project. But they aren’t trying to impose ethics reforms on Missouri; they’re simply seeking a statewide vote. Republicans should support that, too.</p><p>Some Republicans understand this. <a href=\"https://www.cleanmissouri.org/support/\" target=\"_self\">Former Sen. Jack Danforth</a> has endorsed Amendment 1, and a trio of current and former GOP state lawmakers has filed a friend-of-the-court brief arguing that the measure is ballot-worthy.</p><p>Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican, says the Clean Missouri initiative involves a single subject and should go to voters. Clean Missouri submitted more than 340,000 signatures asking that the proposal go on the November ballot.</p><p>They all understand what Green does not: In Missouri, ballot initiatives must be interpreted broadly, with every close call going to the people — not legislators, lobbyists or judges. </p><p>“The trial court’s judgment must be reversed because it misapplied the law,” Clean Missouri supporters told the appeals court in a brief filed over the weekend. “The people should be allowed to vote on the wisdom of the measure.”</p><p>We agree. If opponents of Clean Missouri want to argue against it, or claim Missouri’s legislature is a model of ethical behavior now, they should do so in a campaign.</p><p>They should not be allowed to use the courts to circumvent the judgment of Missourians. </p><p>The Missouri Court of Appeals in Kansas City will hear arguments in the case Thursday, and may rule that day. All Missourians who believe in clean, open government will be watching.</p></div>",

Justin Hughes and Cody Fletcher, a pair of unheralded linebackers not listed on the depth chart, played meaningful snaps. And Eli Walker made his first start at strong safety.</p><p>Those moves were anything but one-time personnel changes made during a lopsided victory. All of those players may be needed again this week in a pressure-packed game at West Virginia.</p><p>Injuries have already hit the Wildcats hard on defense, and they could be down several key players when they take on the No. 12 Mountaineers and their explosive offense. A tough test just got even more difficult.</p><p>“That’s probably one of the worst teams you could line up short-handed against,” K-State coach Bill Snyder said. “They’re a very prolific offense, which they’ve proven over time — not just this year, year in and year out — and they have developed a great deal of balance in their offense.”</p><p>Here are the K-State defensive players who may not be healthy enough to play this weekend:</p><ul><li>Denzel Goolsby: The junior strong safety from Wichita is expected to miss at least a handful more games while he recovers from an unspecified injury sustained against Mississippi State. He wasn’t even on the sideline for the UTSA game. Walker, who made five tackles against the Roadrunners, is the next man up.</li><li>Elijah Sullivan: K-State has taken things slow with the junior linebacker as he recovered from a preseason knee injury. Though he is arguably the best linebacker on the roster, he came off the bench in the first two games and didn’t play at all against UTSA. Consider him questionable this week. If he is unable to play against the Mountaineers, the Wildcats will need strong efforts from Sam Sizelove, Hughes and Fletcher.</li><li>Kevion McGee: The junior defensive back was a pleasant surprise for the Wildcats when he broke up a team high four passes against South Dakota. But he has rarely played since and didn’t see the field against UTSA. Snyder said he is dealing with an injury and is not sure when he will return. Without him, K-State’s secondary has struggled to find depth.</li></ul><p>Those potential absences create new challenges for K-State, which will have its hands full with West Virginia’s offense.</p><p>With Heisman Trophy contender Will Grier at quarterback, dynamic playmakers Gary Jennings and David Sills at receiver and Leddie Brown at running back, the Mountaineers are hard for any defense (even at full strength) to stop.</p><p>West Virginia is averaging 586 yards and 46 points per game.</p><p>The new faces on K-State’s defense will need to mature quickly.</p><p>“Being short-handed is not something you envision and something you want,” Snyder said, “but we’re no different than anybody else. If you have somebody that has to step up and play in place of someone they have to be well prepared to do as well as the other one. It’s the next-up thought, probably, but that’s what you do when you coach. You get guys prepared to step into those situations.”</p></div>",

No scholarships were available for 2018-19.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Christian Braun’s commitment to KU completed a whirlwind couple of weeks for the two-time state champion who averaged 14.2 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.1 assists a game his junior year at BV Northwest.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Christian — he played quite well at the Peach Jam in South Carolina and a tourney in Las Vegas to conclude the summer AAU circuit — was offered a scholarship by KU on Aug. 30 during his unofficial campus visit.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">At that time, he also had offers from MU, Oklahoma, K-State, Texas Tech, Wake Forest and others.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">KU coach Bill Self and assistant Norm Roberts held an in-home visit with the Braun family on Sunday night in Overland Park and Christian offered his commitment just hours later on Monday.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“We discussed where they thought I would fit in and stuff like that,” Braun said Monday.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“It feels right for me and my family. KU has always been a place I wanted to go. I grew up in a small town in Kansas. It’s always been a dream for me. I’m pretty excited for the opportunity when I got it. I figured I should take it and go from there,” Braun added.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Braun made the announcement shortly before 2 p.m. Monday, with this post on Twitter: “First I would like to thank my parents for loving me and caring for me throughout my life and sacrificing everything to put me in the best position for my future. I would also like to thank my coaches for guiding me throughout this process. I would like to thank MoKan for giving me a platform to showcase my ability for the past six years. I am committing to the University of Kansas!”</span></p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p>Braun, who made one official visit, to K-State, was to have traveled to Oklahoma this coming weekend and Illinois in October. Instead he’s committed to sign a letter-of-intent with KU in November.</p><p><span class=\"s1\">“Talking to Coach Self and Roberts … it seems the right fit for me and my family,” Christian Braun said. “I really like the coaching staff. I met the players. I really like them. Obviously I’ve been a KU fan a long time. It seemed to be the right place for me. I can help the program. I think it’s going to be special.”</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">He has talked to Self about the role he’ll play at KU.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“I am more a 2,” he said. “I play a lot of the 2 and 3 and also a bit of 1 if he needs it. Just versatility is something me and coach talk about a lot.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“Right now I’m taking it all in,” added Braun. “I don’t know it’s necessarily hit me yet. Just the opportunity being that it’s Kansas. Once everything settles down I’ll be able to look at it. I’m just pretty excited.”</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Lisa Braun (she indicated the family’s last name is pronounced Brown) said she’s happy she’ll have two sons playing major college basketball in the area.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“They’ve been watching him for years,” Lisa said of KU coaches attending MoKan Elite games and BV Northwest contests. “They’d see him whenever he went to team camps at KU with Coach Fritz (Ed, BV Northwest). Our family … we’re just basketball fans in general. I don’t think we’re real particular of what school or whatever, we just like good ball. That’s what he (Self) is known for. He’s done a super job. You can’t beat the statistics the Jayhawks have had over the years. And we trust him. He’s a go-getter, a class act guy. I don’t think he (Christian) could have picked a better coach,” Lisa added.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"> Proud MU Tiger Lisa would love to see KU and MU play again, especially with sons at both institutions.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">“Oh yes. If we can’t have them play together, it’s always fun to have both kids on the same court,” Lisa Braun said.</span></p><p>Braun’s commitment is KU’s first from a prospect in the Class of 2019. The Jayhawks will have at least one more scholarship available after the departure of senior Lagerald Vick. More scholarships are expected to be available with several non-seniors likely to consider entering the 2019 NBA Draft.</p><p><!-- %asset:217344780% --><br/><br/></p></div>",

But that mantle may have shifted to Rutgers following the Jayhawks’ 55-14 victory over the Scarlet Knight. </p><p>And even if Le Batard doesn’t have harsh words for Rutgers, others unloaded on the team and coach Chris Ash. </p><p>Steve Politi of the Star-Ledger wrote a column with the headline, “<a href=\"https://www.nj.com/rutgersfootball/index.ssf/2018/09/rutgers-kansas_politis_5_observations.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Ash has no excuse for Rutgers’ most humiliating loss ever.”</a></p><p>“I write this without a hint of exaggeration: This might be the most demoralizing, humiliating, unacceptable loss<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>in the modern history of Rutgers<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>football, and yes, I know that’s a high bar to clear,” Politi wrote.</p><p>“You want to go back to the Dark Ages and dig one up that’s worse? Knock yourself out. But don’t try to sell me that 78-0 to Michigan or 80-7 to West Virginia was worse than this, any of those dispiriting Villanova or New Hampshire losses were worse than this, or anything else in recent memory tops what happened here on Saturday afternoon for rock bottom. </p><p>“The Scarlet Knights came to Kansas and got run out of the building by the team that was supposed to be — emphasis on<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>supposed to be<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>— the worst Power 5 team in the country.

Rutgers was completely unprepared to play against a team that loss to Nicholls State in its opener and just snapped a 46-game road losing streak last week. Rutgers was steamrolled by a program that exists so the kind folks have a way to pass the time until basketball season out here.” </p><p>Whew, that’s harsh. </p><p>But Politi wasn’t the only one to rip Rutgers for the loss.</p><p>Aaron Breitman wrote a story on SB Nation’s Rutgers blog with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.onthebanks.com/2018/9/16/17864768/rutgers-football-alarm-bells-ring-in-epic-loss-to-kansas-chris-ash-pat-hobbs-big-ten-ohio-state\" target=\"_blank\">“Rutgers Football: Alarm bells ring in epic loss to Kansas.”</a></p><p>“The loss to the Jayhawks, long considered the worst power five program in college football, was the ultimate embarrassment,” Breitman wrote. “There is no other way to characterize Rutgers football right now other than being in full crisis mode. That’s not being an alarmist, that’s being a realist. ...</p><p>“<span>The team looked uninspired in a hugely important game in their season and didn’t show much fight in a second half with the issue still in doubt. Where is the fire, the swagger, the pride? I’ll repeat, all of these things happened against the program formerly considered the worst of all the power five teams.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p>“This team has a chance to dispose of that title in three weeks when they play Illinois, but that’s the reality we are in my friends. The perception of Rutgers football nationally and within the Big Ten is that it’s a joke and they proved it by losing by six touchdowns to Kansas. They didn’t cover the spread of the Ohio State game ... against Kansas. ...</p><p>“The bottom line is the product on the field is horrendous right now and at the end of the day, it comes down to coaching. You can make the talent disparity argument in getting blown out to Ohio State. There isn’t a significant disparity between Rutgers and Kansas. Certainly not six touchdowns worth.“</p><p>And finally, the Washington Post chimed in ... sort of. Jacob Bogage wrote a piece with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/09/15/only-rutgers-could-make-kansas-look-this-good-p-s-kansas-is-still-bad/?utm_term=.cf0d50fbad57\" target=\"_blank\">“Only Rutgers could make Kansas look this good.

              "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>After a quiet preseason and season-opener, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Sammy Watkins turned in a 100-yard receiving performance against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Week 2 win. </p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Sammy Watkins ran from right to left, darting behind quarterback Patrick Mahomes in time to grab the handoff on a jet sweep. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">He turned the corner, splitting a pair of Pittsburgh defenders and darted up the field. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Steelers dived at Watkins, grasping at his feet. Another tried to grab him from the side, but Watkins extended his arm and shoved him out of the way. Finally, Vince Williams wrapped Watkins up, but the wide receiver still fought for a few extra yards, dipping his shoulder and pushing forward until he was finally brought down seven yards from the goal line. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Watkins, of course, is a receiver by trade, but that 31-yard run in the first quarter of the Chiefs’ 42-37 win at Pittsburgh ultimately settled him down and helped him churn out his best performance since coming to Kansas City.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Kind of felt like a running back,” he said Sunday. “It felt good. It got me going early on. Got tackled and after that, it was kind of like, ‘OK, I’m here.’ Got all the butterflies out.” </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Prior to that long run, Watkins had three catches for 67 yards. By the end of the game, he had seven catches for 100 yards, averaging 16.7 yards per catch. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Though he wasn’t on the receiving end of one of Mahomes’ six touchdown throws, Watkins’ involvement in the offense was somewhat of a welcome relief after a quiet preseason and season-opener. As a new addition to the Chiefs in the offseason, Watkins has immersed himself in the complexities Andy Reid’s playbook. The payoff has been a slow build. But Sunday in Pittsburgh was a sign of positive progress. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Not only did Watkins catch six of seven targets, the lone incompletion coming as Mahomes overthrew him in the end zone early in the third quarter, but he also showed his strength as he broke tackles and ran through contact. Through two weeks, Watkins has 54 yards after catch, averaging six per reception. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I think Sammy Watkins showed everybody some stuff and opened some eyes today to show that he is the real deal,” tight end Travis Kelce said. “He’s going to be one heck of a weapon for us this year.” </p><p dir=\"ltr\">A week earlier against the Chargers, Watkins had three catches on five targets for just 21 yards — a far cry from his earlier days in Buffalo when he infamously demanded to have 10 targets a game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">But Watkins is in a new system now and his mentality has evolved. He’s playing with an array of offensive threats, and he’s OK being selfless.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I’m not going to have 100 yards every game,” Watkins said. “That’s not realistic. But to be out there playing hard, playing physical, blocking. I think that’s what it’s about. It’s not about who got the stats and stuff like that. If I’m playing hard, playing fast and we’re getting wins, that’s what it’s about.” </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Everyone got involved in the offense in Sunday’s win, reflecting what Reid and his players preached throughout training camp and the preseason. It also looked entirely different from what Reid schemed up for Week 1, where most everything flowed through speedy wide receiver Tyreek Hill. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">This time, the emphasis seemed to shift to tight end Travis Kelce and Watkins from the very beginning. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kelce was targeted once on the first drive and caught the touchdown the second. Watkins had back-to-back catches in the second drive, including one that went for 40 yards. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I’m happy for Sammy,” Reid said. “Sammy has gone through a few things through his career, and he comes here as one of the big names, he saw what he is. You get that ball in his hand, and he’s an explosive runner. It’s like you have a running back when he has that ball, big, strong and physical. So, I need to do a better job of making sure we get it to him. Travis Kelce, too, he had a nice game today. A lot of positives.” </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Even with a solid performance, Watkins knows he still has more learning to do. He’s catching on to Reid’s schemes, but he’s not there yet.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“There’s no rush,” Watkins said. “It’s the second game. The coaches are just going to continue to put me in the right positions. I’m going to continue to grow with this offense and today just shows how well we can play together if we continue to work together.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\"> <!-- %asset:217344700% --> </p></div>",

That happens a lot, “everywhere,” said one girl in the video.</p><p>“It upsets me that students would take something that some people value and want, and make it somehow a joke or a punishment to that person, singling them out, especially when it’s someone who doesn’t realize that it’s a joke, and that is just cruel,” a female teacher said in the video.</p><p>Sophomore student council member Maddie Dunlap told MLive that while much of the response to the change has been positive, not everyone is happy.

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Missouri is 3-0 after a last-second win over Purdue but the Tigers go into Saturday’s game against No. 2 Georgia with a lot of problems to fix, mainly on defense. The last time Georgia visited, Missouri blew a late lead and lost on a fourth-down play. A win would propel Drew Lock’s Heisman status, and likely get the Tigers ranked and start contract extension talks for Barry Odom. </p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">The details</h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Kickoff:</b> 11 a.m. Saturday</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Where:</b> Memorial Stadium, Columbia</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>TV:</b> ESPN</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Radio:</b> KMBZ (98.1 FM)</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>The line:</b> Georgia by 16 1/2</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><!-- %asset:217586570% --></p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Five things to know</h3><ol><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Missouri’s offense</b> matched up well against Georgia last season: The Tigers’ 28 points against the Bulldogs were the second-most a team scored on them in the regular season and third most behind Oklahoma and Auburn. While Missouri lost 53-28 in Athens last year, the game was close in the first half.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>And you thought</b> Missouri’s D-line was struggling? Georgia ranks dead last among FBS teams in sacks, with just one. Missouri’s offensive line has done a good job protecting Drew Lock through three games, that should continue.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>This is an interesting game for </b>Derek Dooley: He got his start in coaching as a defensive graduate assistant at Georgia, when coach Kirby Smart was still a player. They go way back. And Dooley’s son J.T. is a walk-on receiver for the Bulldogs. Will Smart put him in the game if the score dictates it?</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>The Tigers’ secondary</b> is a mess: Missouri ranks No. 118 in passing defense. Cornerback DeMarkus Acy went out after the first play at Purdue because of “somewhat of a concussion,” Odom said, and his status for Saturday is unknown. The Tigers missed Acy greatly and can’t afford a repeat performance.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>The stadium should be</b> electric: Missouri AD Jim Sterk told reporters that the Georgia game was close to a sellout before the Purdue game went final. Memorial Stadium should be sold out by Saturday for the first time since the 2014 season finale against Arkansas.</p></li></ol><p dir=\"ltr\"><!-- %asset:217344820% --></p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Kansas football has broken through barriers the last two weeks, and there’s even more new ground to reach if the Jayhawks are able to defeat Baylor in a 2:30 p.m. road game on Saturday.</p><p>In winning at Central Michigan, <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-kansas/article218062145.html\" target=\"_blank\">KU was able to snap an FBS-record 46-game road losing streak</a>. Then, in last week’s blowout win over Rutgers, <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-kansas/article218460905.html\" target=\"_blank\">the Jayhawks picked up their first consecutive victories since the 2011 season</a>.</p><p>KU has not won a Big 12 road game since Oct. 4, 2009, and a victory also would give KU three wins in four games. That might not seem like much, but — if it happened — it would tie the highest win total of any Jayhawks team in any of the last nine seasons ... with eight games on the schedule still remaining. </p><h3 style=\"font-size: 1.71429em;\">The details</h3><p><b>Kickoff:</b> 2:30 p.m. Saturday</p><p><b>Where:</b> McLane Stadium, Waco, Texas</p><p><b>TV: </b>FS1</p><p><b>Radio:</b> WHB (810 AM) in Kansas City, KFH (1240 AM) in Wichita</p><p><b>The line:</b> Baylor by 9 1/2</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><h3 style=\"font-size: 1.71429em;\">Five things to know</h3><ol><li><b>Pooka is for real.</b> True freshman running back Pooka Williams, <a href=\"https://t.co/5pJqI2AAdz\" target=\"_blank\">who rushed for 158 yards against Rutgers</a>, is starting to get national attention. Not only was he one of two running backs on Pro Football Focus’ All-Offense team this week, but through three weeks, the site has him <a href=\"https://t.co/5pJqI2AAdz\" target=\"_blank\">graded as the No. 1 running back in the nation</a>.</li><li><b>KU has turned around its turnovers.</b> The Jayhawks’ plus-12 turnover differential this season ranks first nationally. Remember, KU finished at minus-17 a year ago.</li><li><b>Baylor has owned the recent matchups.</b> In Beaty’s three previous seasons, he’s lost to Baylor and 66-7, 49-7 and 38-9. The Bears have also outscored the Jayhawks, 205-42, during the teams’ last four games in Waco.</li><li><b>The Bears’ offense has been ahead of their defense this year.</b> Baylor is 32nd in offense and 98th in defense <a href=\"https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/ncaa\" target=\"_blank\">according to Bill Connelly’s advanced S&amp;P+ rankings</a>. The Bears’ strength is their passing game, as they’ve averaged 8.9 yards per attempt (tied for 30th nationally) while racking up 19, 20-plus-yard passing plays (tied for fourth).</li><li><b>Is there a chance? </b>KU is only a 9 1/2-point underdog, which is even more amazing considering recent history. According to the database at OddsShark, KU has been a single-digit road underdog in a Big 12 game <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessenewell/status/1041721603808210947\" target=\"_blank\">only one time in its previous 30 outings</a>. That was at Iowa State on Nov. 23, 2013 (four-point underdog) in a contest KU lost 34-0.</li></ol><p> <!-- %asset:217344790% --> </p></div>",

We’re about to find out. </p><p>This will not be an easy opener. The Wildcats (2-1) head to Morgantown as 14 1/2-point underdogs against the No. 12 Mountaineers (2-0). But <a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/sports/college/big-12/kansas-state/article218407150.html\" target=\"_blank\">they did get a confidence boost over the weekend from a 41-17 victory over Texas-San Antonio</a>, while West Virginia players sat at home following the cancellation of their game against North Carolina State because of Hurricane Florence.</p><h3 style=\"font-size: 1.71429em;\">The details</h3><p><b>Kickoff:</b> 2:30 p.m. Saturday</p><p><b>Where:</b> Milan Puskar Stadium, Morgantown, W.Va.</p><p><b>TV:</b> ESPN</p><p><b>Radio:</b> KQAM (1480 AM) in Wichita, KCSP (610 AM) in Kansas City</p><p><b>The line:</b> West Virginia by 14 1/2</p><p><!-- %asset:217586570% --></p><h3 style=\"font-size: 1.71429em;\">Five things to know</h3><ol><li><b>The Mountaineers have one of the nation’s most explosive offenses.</b> With Heisman Trophy contender Will Grier at quarterback and dynamic playmakers Gary Jennings and David Sills at receiver, it’s difficult for any defense to slow this passing attack. West Virginia flexed its offensive muscles in its first two games, routing Tennessee 40-14 and Youngstown State 52-17. WVU is averaging 586 yards per game.</li><li><b>This is Dana Holgorsen’s most complete team</b> of his eight-year tenure with the Mountaineers. Not only is this West Virginia group loaded on offense, it is also playing solid defense, allowing 297 yards per game. </li><li><b>West Virginia has had K-State’s number in recent years.</b> K-State won its first five games against West Virginia when the Mountaineers joined the Big 12 in 2012, but the Wildcats haven’t had any luck the past two years. West Virginia won both, including 28-23 last year in Manhattan. </li><li><b>This could be K-State’s most difficult game of the season.</b> The Wildcats have already played No. 14 Mississippi State and must later take on No. 5 Oklahoma, but West Virginia could be every bit as challenging. The Mountaineers 3-4 defense and high-flying offense are always difficult to prepare for.</li><li><b>K-State may be short handed again on defense. </b>Starting safety Denzel Goolsby isn’t expected to return from injury anytime soon. Defensive back Kevion McGee has missed two straight games because of an injury. And Linebacker Elijah Sullivan remains questionable after missing the UTSA game. The Wildcats will need players like Eli Walker and Sam Sivelove to step up on defense against a formidable opponent.</li></ol></div>",

Tyreek Hill returned the kick against the Chargers 91 yards for a touchdown, and De’Anthony Thomas returned his 48 yards to set up a short-field score against the Steelers. No one’s postgame smile in the first two weeks has been bigger than special teams coach Dave Toub.</p><h3>Sack opportunity?</h3><p>The Chiefs got one against the Steelers when Allen Bailey got his arms around Ben Roelisthberger. That’s a week after Dee Ford got the team’s lone sack against the Chargers. Could this week be the game the defense steps up in a bigger way? In the 49ers’ 30-27 victory over the Lions on Sunday, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was sacked six times and has been taken down nine times this season.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217344615% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Three high-profile commitments with two months to go until the November signing period is a pretty good spot for John Calipari to be in, and his early recruiting haul received more accolades last week with Rivals.com’s latest update to its <a href=\"https://n.rivals.com/prospect_rankings/rivals150/2019\">class of 2019 rankings</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The biggest mover among players ranked in the top 20 was <a href=\"https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2019/kahlil-whitney-171026\">Kahlil Whitney</a>, who committed to Kentucky last month and jumped from No. 23 to No. 7 on Rivals’ list.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The only other committed player in the new top 10 was <a href=\"https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2019/tyrese-maxey-171839\">Tyrese Maxey</a>, the affable point guard from Texas who committed to the Cats back in May and is the No. 9 player in the country.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And the highest-ranked high school player from Kentucky? That would be Pendleton County’s <a href=\"https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2019/dontaie-allen-225600\">Dontaie Allen</a>, who picked UK in early August and is ranked No. 54 nationally by Rivals.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“It’s the start of what you expect from John Calipari and Kentucky in recruiting,” Rivals.com national analyst Eric Bossi told the Herald-Leader. “They’re off to a great start.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Bossi added that he expects Kentucky to land “two or three more big-time guys” in the 2019 cycle and contend for the honor of No. 1 recruiting class in the country yet again. Calipari visited five of the six top-ranked prospects in the new Rivals rankings — Vernon Carey, James Wiseman, Jaden McDaniels, Isaiah Stewart and Matthew Hurt — <a href=\"https://www.kentucky.com/sports/college/kentucky-sports/uk-recruiting/article218514525.html\">over the past week alone</a>, and several other highly touted players remain on his 2019 wish list.</p><p> <!-- %asset:218348885% --> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Cats’ recruiting haul so far is <a href=\"https://basketballrecruiting.rivals.com/news/rivals-rankings-week-five-programs-that-should-be-pleased-2\">good enough for the No. 2 national ranking</a> — behind Southern Cal — and it’s a group led by Whitney, an athletic wing player from Chicago who was measured at 6-7.5 with a 6-10.5 wingspan at last month’s Nike Skills Academy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Such drastic moves — from No. 23 to No. 7 — are not often seen within the five-star ranking zone, but Whitney has had an especially impressive year so far.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I don’t think anyone has ever disputed how talented he was. But he hasn’t always been in the situation to be the man,” Bossi said. “This spring and summer was really the first time where he was clear cut with the opportunity to be the man, and we really liked what we saw from him in the spring. We toyed with maybe moving him into the top 15 after the spring, but we just kind of wanted that one more summer of, ‘OK, let’s watch and be sure that this is really what we think of him.’ And he was even better during July.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“A lot of kids talk about getting serious in the gym and putting in the time and committing to their craft, but you can see once they hit the floor who is really about that life and who isn’t. And Kahlil has clearly been about that. His jump shot is much improved. His ball handling is much improved. A consistent motor and effort and trying to step on people’s throats — that’s him now. And that hasn’t always been the case.”</p><p>Whitney, who plays for Roselle Catholic (N.J.), the alma mater of former UK player Isaiah Briscoe, has acknowledged past issues with not sustaining his energy on the court. He showed over the summer that motor is no longer a problem, and analysts have taken notice.<a href=\"https://247sports.com/Season/2019-Basketball/RecruitRankings/?InstitutionGroup=HighSchool\"> 247Sports ranks him No. 6 nationally</a>, and<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/playerrankings/_/view/espnu100/sort/rank/class/2019\"> ESPN has him at No. 9</a>.<br/><br/></p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I think he has to be looked at as a legitimate one-and-done candidate at this point,” Bossi said. “What happens in college and over the next year of high school will obviously play into that. He’s reached this point. Now he can’t settle and feel like he’s made it. He probably needs to work even harder than he’s worked to get to where he is. But that potential is certainly there, and he does look to me now like a guy who isn’t just going to be a good college player. He’s going to be a guy who can come in and make an immediate and big impact right away as a freshman.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Maxey and Allen are obviously important additions, too, and Rivals.com national analyst Corey Evans says the versatility of this initial trio should give Kentucky several options — both on the court and in the way the Cats finish out the 2019 recruiting cycle. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“They have the top in-state prospect — and one of the best isolation scorers on the wing — with Dontaie Allen,” Evans told the Herald-Leader. “They have maybe the biggest alpha dog of them all with Kahlil Whitney. And they have the biggest personality with Tyrese Maxey. So it’s not a bland class whatsoever. It checks a lot of the boxes when it comes to energy, scoring, shooting, defense, toughness.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“I think it just gives Calipari and his staff a lot of wiggle room going into the fall, as far as what they need or what they want. Because guys like Maxey and Whitney, they can mask so many other holes that might be there.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:212444894% --> </p><p> <!-- %asset:215716970% --> </p></div>",

              "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Writers at the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and others wrote or talked about how Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes had had an incredible start to the 2018 season.</p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ amazing start to the season — 10 touchdowns, no interceptions — has helped the Chiefs to a pair of big road wins over the Chargers and Steelers.</p><p>It’s got Chiefs fans buzzing, and here’s the thing, members of the national media are also gushing over Mahomes. The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and Yahoo Sports all had stories about Mahomes’ quick start. I’ve included a snippet of what each person wrote and you can click the link to read the full stories, although some may require a paid subscription.</p><p>Here is what people are saying.</p><p>Adam Kilgore of the Washington Post wrote a story with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/09/16/the-nfl-belongs-to-patrick-mahomes-now/?utm_term=.3adf1cd21600\">“The NFL belongs to Patrick Mahomes now.”</a></p><p>“His physical ability and phenomenal performances fail to encapsulate Mahomes’s place in the league,” Kilgore wrote. “He’s too physically gifted to be seen as a prototype — good luck finding the next mobile, 6-foot-3 quarterback who can throw it 70 yards in the air. But Mahomes — a collegiate product of the ‘Air Raid’ offense, a starting quarterback on his rookie deal, a triggerman for Andy Reid’s designs and a conductor of concepts taken from college football — is something close to an ideal of modern NFL quarterback. He fits into every way the league is leaning.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Reid’s schemes have become the model for how offense is played. Seven NFL head coaches once coached under Reid, including reigning Super Bowl winner Doug Pederson and the Chicago Bears’s Matt Nagy, whose creative play-calling would have been the talk of the league if not for Aaron Rodgers’s heroics last Sunday night in Green Bay’s comeback victory. Mahomes’s talent may have made him a star in any setting, but he landed with perhaps the best developer of quarterbacks and most influential offensive mind in the game.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kilgore concludes with this:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“And so Sunday may have only been a start for Mahomes. He will face stiffer challenges than Pittsburgh’s secondary, to be sure, and not every Sunday will feel like a glimpse into a fluorescent future of the sport. But through two weeks, Mahomes hasn’t only been the most impressive player in the league. He’s been a signpost of where the sport is headed.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Andrew Beaton of the Wall Street Journal wrote a story with the headline, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/patrick-mahomes-is-conquering-the-nfl-1537136770?mod=e2tws\">“Patrick Mahomes is conquering the NFL.”</a></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Beaton opened the piece by writing about the risk the Chiefs took in trading away Alex Smith, who had a great season, and making the unproven Mahomes the starter.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Two weeks into this season, it’s no longer reasonable to question if Mahomes is good, and it’s far more reasonable to ponder if Mahomes is great,” Beaton wrote. “That much was clear after his second consecutive monster game. He threw for six touchdowns in a 42-37 win against the Steelers—giving him 10 through the season’s first two weeks.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes, 22 years old, is now the youngest player in the Super Bowl era with a six-touchdown passing game. His 10 throwing scores are a record for the first two weeks of the season. But his eye-popping statistics, somehow, aren’t even the most jarring aspect of what he has done so far. That’s because somehow what he has done is less notable than how he has done it. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes has dazzled with heaves uncommon in the modern NFL, which has increasingly shifted toward favoring high-probability short passes over riskier and longer ones. Mahomes has taken that trend and blasted it to smithereens with the bazooka attached to the right side of his torso.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yahoo Sports’ Terez Paylor, the former Kansas City Star writer, had a column with the headline, <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/legend-patrick-mahomes-grows-chiefs-appear-found-qb-savior-013002515.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The legend of Patrick Mahomes grows as the Chiefs appear to have found their QB savior.”</a></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Paylor mentioned the Chiefs’ past troubles against the Steelers and why Sunday’s win meant that much more in Kansas City.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes has shown it all in wins against the Steelers and Chargers, including a rifle arm, moxie and the ability to throw under duress and from different platforms. The Chiefs needed every last drop of his talent to come out with the win on Sunday, as Mahomes managed to outduel (Ben) Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh’s future Hall of Famer, who completed 39 of 60 passes for 452 yards and three touchdowns.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Mahomes’ numbers already look ridiculous on the surface, but his performance is even more impressive when you consider it came against a Steelers team whose reliance on a fire zone pressure – where five defenders rush the passer and while the others (including defensive linemen) drop into coverage — has vexed the Chiefs in all of their previous five meetings under Reid.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Paylor later added: “Time after time against the Steelers, Mahomes’ ability to keep his eyes up under pressure, scan the pocket and deliver lasers from different platforms and launch points made the difference. The Steelers even became so weary of seeing Mahomes defeat their blitz packages that by the end of the game, they’d started dialing back on the blitzing in lieu of dropping more men into coverage.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Do not underestimate the importance of this. It is the ultimate show of respect, one reserved almost solely for quarterbacks like Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady, guys who can use their brains and rocket arms to destroy the zone blitzes that naturally leave defenses thin on players in actual coverages.”</p><p>Finally, it should come as no surprise that Peter Schrager, who is on “Good Morning Football” on the NFL Network, was wowed by Mahomes on Sunday:</p><p> <!-- %asset:218530770% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">A prediction: Arrowhead Stadium is going to be loud on Sunday. Really loud.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The unbeaten Chiefs will make their 2018 home debut Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers, and it will be the first home start of quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ career. Kickoff is at noon and the game is on WDAF (Ch. 4).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Having knocked off the preseason AFC West favorite Chargers and long-time nemesis Pittsburgh, both on the road, the Chiefs are likely to be fired up for the game, too.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In fact, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickMahomes5/status/1041445889510920194\">Mahomes tweeted</a> after Sunday’s win over the Steelers: “We are just getting started..! We are coming home #ChiefsKindom”</p><p>I’m providing a quick overview of the next Chiefs’ opponent early in each week, and here are five things to know about the 49ers, 1-1.</p><p> <!-- %asset:218539425% --> </p><h3>Jimmy G</h3><p>The 49ers were a preseason darling thanks to quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo’s strong finish to the 2017 season after being traded from New England to San Francisco. The Niners won their last five games and many expected they’d make the postseason behind Garoppolo.</p><p>But in the 49ers’ opener, Garoppolo threw three interceptions in a loss at Minnesota. On Sunday, San Francisco beat the Lions 30-27 but Garoppolo dodged a bullet. Nursing that three-point lead late in the game, the Lions’ Tracy Walker intercepted a pass that was returned to the San Francisco 7. Garoppolo was bailed out by a defensive holding call on the other side of the field.</p><p>Garoppolo has completed 33 of 59 passes for 467 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions this season.</p><h3>Meet Matt Breida</h3><p>San Francisco running back Matt Breida rushed for 138 yards against the Lions and broke off a 66-yard touchdown scamper that was the 49ers’ longest TD run in four seasons. A big block aided Breida:</p><p><!-- %asset:218528265% --></p><p>Breida, who is in his second season after signing as an undrafted free agent out of Georgia Southern, has 22 rushing attempts this season for 184 yards. Former Washington running back Alfred Morris has 86 yards rushing in 26 attempts.</p><h3>Red Zone troubles</h3><p>The 49ers made five trips to the red zone against the Lions but had to settle for a field goal three times. Garoppolo was sacked three times on those three drives that ended in field goals.</p><p>Against the Vikings in the opener, San Francisco got to the red zone four times. Here is what happened:</p><p>1. Morris fumbled at the 1</p><p>2. Settled for a 33-yard field goal</p><p>3. Scored a touchdown</p><p>4. Had to kick a 22-yard field goal.</p><p>So that’s nine trips to the red zone and just three touchdowns scored this season for the Niners.</p><h3>Richard Sherman</h3><p>The 49ers signed cornerback Richard Sherman this summer. He was a four-time Pro Bowler, a first-team All-Pro three times and won a Super Bowl with the Seattle Seahawks before coming to San Francisco.</p><p>Sherman made two tackles Sunday against the Lions and recovered a fumble in the 49ers’ season opener at Minnesota.</p><p>Heading into Monday night’s game, the 49ers rank 23rd in pass defense (278 yards per game) and are tied for the fourth-most touchdown passes allowed. Two of the top three are teams the Chiefs have played: Pittsburgh at No. 1 and the Chargers are tied for second with the Bills.</p><h3>A new receiver?</h3><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1041328126813458432\" target=\"_blank\">ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported</a> that the Cleveland Browns are expected to trade wide receiver Josh Gordon and hope to send him to a team in the NFC.</p><p>Gordon can’t dictate where the Browns will trade him, but he would like to go to Dallas or San Francisco, Schefter reported.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/49ers/article/John-Lynch-49ers-have-called-about-Browns-WR-13233684.php\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco Chronicle reported</a> that 49ers general manager John Lynch has contacted the Browns about Gordon.</p></div>",

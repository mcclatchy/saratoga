              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p class=\"p1\">The secret of the most anticipated Chiefs season in years is that this is not a Super Bowl contender, no matter <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/for-petes-sake/article217786245.html\" target=\"_blank\">what some in the national media are saying</a>.</p><p class=\"p1\">Might not even be a playoff team.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is not written to inflame or mock. This is not written simply because Eric Berry’s health remains uncertain, or the defense looked awful in the preseason. This is a sober look at a team with a first-year starting quarterback, major questions on defense and perhaps most convincingly a line of personnel moves that are subtly but consistently pointing to a more serious push beginning in 2019.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is not a hot take, in other words.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is the plan.</p><p class=\"p1\">Look at the biggest moves. Alex Smith was traded for a Kendall Fuller, a young and rising cornerback, and draft picks, the higher of which comes next year. This happened because the team wanted to build around young quarterback Patrick Mahomes, a tantalizing talent but one who so far has only torched Big 12 defenses at Texas Tech.</p><p class=\"p1\">Cornerback Marcus Peters was also traded, essentially because the organization was tired of repairing and reinforcing and worrying in his wake. Peters is young and game-changing and still cheap. You think a team that believes it’s close to a Super Bowl gives up on that?</p><p class=\"p1\">Of course not, but a team that believes it’s close to a Super Bowl will trade for that, which is why the Rams added him to one of the league’s most talented rosters.</p><p class=\"p1\">The free-agent moves were done with the future in mind, too. Sammy Watkins is just 25, and his red zone effectiveness (seven of his eight touchdowns last year were 17 yards or less) is seen as a complement to the 24-year-old Tyreek Hill (10 of his 13 career touchdown catches are 30 yards or more) to aid the development of the 22-year-old Mahomes.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217921400% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">Anthony Hitchens is just 26, a three-down linebacker the Chiefs think pairs well with Reggie Ragland inside and, more importantly, can be a pillar aside Justin Houston and Eric Berry to strengthen what football people refer to as “the culture.” That’s not a quick fix.</p><p class=\"p1\">You see the commonality here? Get younger, create stable support for a first-year starting quarterback and build a culture that will help rather than impede.</p><p class=\"p1\">The truth is the Chiefs’ defense probably had too many holes to fix all in one offseason, but certain circumstances also played against them.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Chiefs may have prioritized Bears cornerback Kyle Fuller in free agency, and if so it would have been on brand. He’s Kendall’s brother, another dependable teammate, and he would’ve strengthened a premium position.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">But after the Bears used their franchise tag on Fuller, the backup options were less enticing. Trumaine Johnson and Malcolm Butler each had varying so-called “character” questions, which would’ve been a difficult sell while talking about culture.</p><p class=\"p1\">Aaron Colvin would’ve been an upgrade, but the price — $34 million including $18 million guaranteed — was high for a player now listed as a backup on the Texans’ depth chart.</p><p class=\"p1\">So, the Chiefs spent bigger money on fewer players, with the caveat that the talent would still be in prime years in 2019 and 2020.</p><p class=\"p1\">The roster is full of “development guys,” particularly in the secondary — corners Charvarius Ward and Tremon Smith, safety Jordan Lucas and to a slightly lesser extent Armani Watts. The Chiefs will have an extra second-round pick next year, and will likely draft at least one cornerback high.</p><p class=\"p1\">If that’s the way it goes, the biggest concern going forward could be the pass rush. The Chiefs need as much as they can get from Houston as he enters his 30s, and more importantly they need some real production from a second rusher.</p><p class=\"p1\">Dee Ford is the most likely to make an impact in 2018, but he’s inconsistent, with unreliable health, can be a liability against the run, and will be a free agent after the season.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217768120% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">Rookie Breeland Speaks may be better suited inside — he played there in college, and could make an effective tandem with Chris Jones rushing in sub packages. If that’s the way it goes, the Chiefs would need some combination of retaining Ford, getting regular production from Tanoh Kpassagnoh, drafting a pass rusher high, or picking through a free agent class that could include Jadeveon Clowney.</p><p class=\"p1\">The other thing going on here is a tangible priority on the defensive front, perhaps influenced by the current Super Bowl champions.</p><p class=\"p1\">The discussion around the Eagles’ run typically centers around (Reid protege) Doug Pederson’s creativity, and that’s obviously a critical element.</p><p class=\"p1\">But the Eagles also won with a defense that ranked fourth in points, fourth in yards and second in Football Outsiders’ DVOA with a group of corners that nobody would envy. The strength of that group was up front, and with the safeties. The Chiefs could try to emulate.</p><p class=\"p1\">Either way, the Chiefs are approaching this as more than a quick fix. That may mean fewer wins in 2018. If that’s the way this goes, it won’t be a failure.</p><p class=\"p1\">It’ll be the plan.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217344510% --> </p></div>",

And as people were calling in they were getting it,” he told those who were still tuned in.</p><p>“That was not me. It was not us. It was inappropriate.

Six work in Washington, D.C., including Kelsey and Sarah, who work for Customs and Border Protection and the Justice Department’s public affairs office, respectively. </p><p>Another is a scheduler for a house member from California, one just finished her masters in International and European Politics at the University of Edinburgh and another works for an automotive product manufacturer in Ohio.</p><p>“I had played one season of fantasy previously with people from work which was majority men, so it was exciting that I would be playing with all women,” Erika wrote in our email chain. “I work for an automotive product manufacturer in Columbus (Ohio) which is a male dominated industry, so having an all-lady league is a refreshing opportunity to discuss football with someone other than a middle aged father of three.” </p><p>Preach, girl. </p><p>We have Steelers fans, Giants fans, Patriots fans, Browns fans and fans of watching football with friends on Sunday afternoons. </p><p>And of course, we have me. You’d think a football writer would have an unfair advantage in a fantasy football league. </p><p>You’d also be wrong. </p><p>To be clear, I’m not bad because I don’t understand how it works. I’m bad because I’m a big softy. I draft guys who I’ve covered and ones who I have a genuine interest in following off the field. It mimics my approach for telling stories on the beats I cover, which works great for reporting and not so much for competitive fantasy football leagues. <br/><br/></p><p>Last year Erika — team name Gurley Show — won the league, and Sarah came in second. Laura, known this year as Gronk A Donk, was third. Honestly, I have no idea where I finished, but I know that I didn’t win any money. Based on the fact that I had the third pick this year, I’m guessing I was somewhere toward the bottom. <br/><br/></p><p>With my drafting habits, I know that’s shocking. </p><p>I know some fantasy leagues have elaborate draft ceremonies and make an event out of it. That’s not what we did. Kelsey, the commissioner, sent out an email Sunday night to schedule it. We exchanged emails in a thread through Monday afternoon and hastily decided that Monday night worked best for all of us. </p><p>Because Sarah was catching a flight and others had other fantasy drafts, Kelsey gave us 30 seconds per pick. </p><p>Talk about stress. </p><p>I can’t pick out what scented candle I want at Target in 30 seconds, much less decide on which players will help me to a yet another mediocre finish. </p><p>My team — Post Mahomes — started out on a strong note, picking up Todd Gurley with my first selection. As a fellow North Carolinian, Gurley fits my rule of drafting guys I have some kind of connection to. </p><p>In between rounds, I tried to FaceTime my fiancé for some advice, but things were moving so quickly that I got stressed and ended the call before he could really help. Big mistake. </p><p>He did advise me to draft Christian McCaffrey, which I did. I briefly covered McCaffrey’s brother, Max, at Duke, so it still adheres to my draft method. </p><p>In the next round, I finally put my NFL knowledge to use. I was torn between drafting Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, but ultimately went with Kelce because I think he’ll get more targets than Hill based on the preseason. </p><p>Then I started to panic in the 30-second windows.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">I drafted both </span>Demaryius Thomas<em> </em>and Emmanuel Sanders in back-to-back rounds. I don’t have a good explanation for it, either. I was about to autodraft a defense out of my cue in the seventh round, and I saw Sanders’ name on the list of top available players, so I just pulled the trigger with a second left. Their Bye Week is going to be painful. </p><p>It turns out I wasn’t the only one who panicked under pressure. </p><p>Taylor drafted three defenses and three quarterbacks, and Kelsey forgot to draft a backup quarterback. </p><p>I feel good about my starting lineup — Deshaun Watson, Gurley, McCaffrey, Thomas, Jarvis Landry, Kelce, Sanders, Bears defense and Sebastian Janikowski. My bench is almost entirely players from OU, UNC or North Carolina: Adrian Peterson, Sterling Shepard, Tarik Cohen, Kenny Stills, Gio Bernard and Mitch Trubisky. Calvin Ridley rounds out the bench as the only non-NC or OU tie. </p><p>This week, I’m opening up the season against Kelsey (team name: Captain Kirk And The Giants). She’s ultra-competitive, so I’m already preparing to get my butt kicked. She’s starting Phillip Rivers — bolo tie and all — against KC’s secondary, so I like her chances even more. </p></div>",

But that’s exactly what the oddsmakers in Vegas must do anyway.</p><p>And they envision the Chiefs taking a step backwards, albeit a small one.</p><p>After three consecutive double-digit win seasons, Vegas has placed the Chiefs’ regular season over-under for wins at 8 1/2, according to Bovada. They need nine victories, in other words, to make the over wager a winning ticket.</p><p>The oddsmakers don’t like the Chiefs’ chances to repeat as the AFC West champions either. The Los Angeles Chargers are listed as the favorite to win the division, followed by the Chiefs.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p>Kansas City’s odds to win the Super Bowl are 25-to-1, which falls into the middle of the pack in the NFL. The Patriots are the favorite at 5-to-1, with the Eagles and Rams both 8-to-1.</p><p>What do the odds suggest about the statistical seasons the individual players might produce?</p><p>Let’s start with Mahomes. They have the over/under lines listed at 3,750 yards, 23 touchdowns and 13 1/2 interceptions. Only four players have higher interception totals. But the ceiling on Mahomes remains relatively high. He’s listed at 60-to-1 to win the league’s most valuable player award, tied for the 20th best odds in the NFL. For comparison’s sake, Alex Smith had 4,042 yards, 26 touchdowns and five interceptions in 2017.</p><p>Running back Kareem Hunt led the league in rushing as a rookie last season, finishing with 1,327 yards, eight rushing touchdowns. His 2018 projections in Vegas are 1,150 rushing yards and 10 1/2 rushing touchdowns, per Bovada. Ten players have better odds to win the rushing title than Hunt, even though he holds the belt.</p><p>The forecast for tight end Travis Kelce and wide receiver Tyreek Hill are quite similar. Each has their over/under for receiving yards listed at an even 1,000. Hill’s over/under for total touchdowns — receiving, rushing and returning combined — are seven. Kelce’s receiving touchdowns are listed at six. Hill had 1,183 yards and eight total touchdowns in 2017. Kelce had 1,038 yards and eight touchdowns.</p><p>So why do the sports betting oddsmakers set Kelce and Hill with slightly worse outputs this year? A couple of factors are at play. First, they don’t believe Mahomes will repeat the season Smith had last year. And second, there is another player to split the touches with.</p><p>Incoming wide receiver Sammy Watkins’ over/under for yards and touchdowns in his first season in Kansas City are 800 and 5 1/2, respectively. Those are much higher numbers than the Chiefs got from their No. 2 wide receiver a year ago. While Watkins caught eight scores last season, the yardage would be a significant bump in his production. Watkins had only 593 yards in 2017 with the Rams and just 430 yards in an injury-ravaged season in 2016. An injury, of course, would not negate the wager.</p><p>On the defensive side, linebacker Justin Houston is calculated for eight sacks. Houston has proved one of the most difficult players for Vegas to set lines, given his injury history. He had 9 1/2 sacks in 2017 but only four in 2016 and just 7 1/2 in 2015.</p><p>In their opener, the Chiefs are a 3 1/2-point underdog against the Chargers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> <br/><br/></span></p><p> <!-- %asset:217344670% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>This summer’s public forums on the future of Santa Fe Commons Park in downtown Overland Park generated one clear message from residents: <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/community/joco-913/article215357265.html\" target=\"_blank\">Don’t move the Farmers’ Market to the park</a>.</p><p>But the question remained, how could the city upgrade the space that is downtown’s central park and make it a more vibrant destination for residents, families and visitors?</p><p>On Wednesday night, the council’s community development committee voted unanimously for a plan that keeps the market where it is, at 7950 Marty St., but provides a new performance space, playground and enhanced green space within the park at 8045 Santa Fe Drive. The plan goes to the full council Oct. 1 for consideration.</p><p>“There’s a lot of things that we don’t have that we’ve been asked about over the years,” Park Services Director Greg Ruether told the committee. “What new could go into this location?”<br/><br/></p><p>The budget for the park improvements is $3 million and Ruether said the approved concept is designed to keep to that funding limit. Of the $3 million, $1 million is coming in a donation from retired car dealer Frank Thompson, a longtime philanthropist from Overland Park, and his wife Evangeline. </p><p>On Aug. 6, the city council approved an agreement that calls for Santa Fe Commons Park to be renamed Thompson Park once the upgrades are completed.</p><p>Amenities would include improved restrooms and shelters, a water feature with spray or mist, a contemporary children’s playground, natural play areas and space for table tennis, and a new open performance venue with a “paper airplane” shaped roof that would be a nod to Overland Park’s transportation past. </p><p>The conceptual plan was dubbed “Park Stroll,” by the Omaha-based RDG Planning &amp; Design landscape architecture firm, which came up with <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article213247329.html\" target=\"_blank\">four concepts for the city</a> to consider over the summer. Two concepts were for the park only, and two were for incorporating the farmers’ market into the park. Following several public forums and meetings with downtown business advocates and other stakeholders, Ruether said, the “Park Stroll” concept was the consensus choice.</p><p>It would preserve the existing Carriage House, which dates from the early 1900s, and keep as many of the healthy trees as possible. It calls for replacing the deteriorating bandstand and broken sidewalks and fixing or replacing other aging infrastructure.</p><p>Bruce Niedermyer with RDG said the southern half of the park would remain as open and natural as possible, to create an urban lawn, almost like a “front yard,” for the nearby Santa Fe Towers apartments, whose many residents cherish the park and didn’t want substantial changes.</p><p>Ruether said he had appreciated his meeting with the Santa Fe Towers residents, describing them as “the nicest and most opinionated people.” He said the debate over moving the farmers’ market had been polarizing, but it was a useful discussion, and the feedback from <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article213247329.html\" target=\"_blank\">well over 100 city residents</a> and other stakeholders had been crucial to the city’s decision on the best direction for the park. </p><p>Many people felt shoehorning the farmers’ market into the park would reduce the desirable green space while also cramping the market. Parking was also a concern. City officials have determined that improving the market at its present location honors its 36-year history and is the best option, although those construction upgrades will have to be phased in over time to minimize disruptions to vendors and customers.</p><p>Some residents now have a new concern: they’ve objected to the renaming, arguing it was done with no public input. They believe the Santa Fe Commons name should be preserved and is a better tie to Overland Park’s historical connection to the Santa Fe Trail. But the committee took no testimony on the renaming Wednesday night.</p><p>About three dozen people attended Wednesday’s public hearing, and several testified that they were relieved and pleased with the chosen concept.</p><p>“I think that can make a beautiful addition to our city,” said Linda McGuckin, who lives nearby.</p><p>Others questioned some of the elements.</p><p>“I treasure the fact that the park is natural,” said Rich Kaufman, adding that he thinks all the new park structures will detract from its natural character. He thought the “paper airplane” shaped roof for the performance space was silly and advised, “Get rid of that element. Make it a glider.”</p><p>Kaufman and several others also wondered why the park improvements need to occur now. They suggested the city should wait until multiple downtown construction projects are completed in a few years to see if park changes are really needed.</p><p>But Councilman Paul Lyons opposed waiting and said the city can coordinate the park construction with other projects to try to reduce parking problems and inconvenience.</p><p>“I think we should go full steam ahead,” he said. “I think it’s going to be a great amenity.”</p><p>If the council approves the concept, more detailed designs go to the Overland Park Planning Commission, probably late this year or early next year. Ruether said the schedule calls for construction in 2019.</p></div>",

She was <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nun-caught-smuggling-a-kilo-of-cocaine-in-high-heeled-shoes-vbvvkcmrg\" target=\"_blank\">caught smuggling the cocaine</a> by customs officers at the Sydney Airport, The Times in the U.K. reported. </p><p><!-- %asset:217915935% --> </p><p>When in court for her arrest, though, Denise Marie Woodrum said she was “tricked” by a man she met on the internet, The Times reported this week. She also previously told the Australian-based court that <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/devout-us-woman-jailed-for-smuggling-cocaine-in-her-high-heels-20180906-p5022m.html\" target=\"_blank\">she fell in love with that man</a>, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. That man went by “Hendrik Cornelius,” the paper reported, and they never met in person. </p><p>Woodrum, a lay associate with the Catholic order Adorers of the Blood of Christ, said she thought <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/devout-us-woman-found-with-cocaine-hidden-in-her-shoes-at-sydney-airport-20180809-p4zwho.html\" target=\"_blank\">she would never fall in love again</a> after a failed marriage, The Sydney Morning Herald reported, but that changed when she met Cornelius. </p><p><!-- %asset:217918835% --> </p><p>A lay associate is “someone who is <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/08/15/missouri-woman-busted-at-sydney-airport-for-smuggling-cocaine-inside-high-heels-officials-say.html\" target=\"_blank\">inspired by the spirituality of a particular order</a> and seeks to follow it in their private life,” Cheryl Wittenauer, communications director for the Adorers of the Blood of Christ in St. Louis, told Fox News. The woman has been involved with the order for at least five years, Fox reported, and once considered becoming a nun. </p><p>In January, she pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug, Fox reported. On Thursday, she was <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/denise-woodrum-jailed-australia-cocaine\" target=\"_blank\">sentenced to seven and a half years in prison</a> with a non-parole period of four and a half years, BuzzFeed News reported. </p><p>Woodrum’s laywer, though, believed she had been “groomed” to help Cornelius.</p><p>“There are fraudsters out there who are relying on women who are vulnerable,” attorney Rebecca Neil said  in court, according to the Morning Herald. </p><p>The online couple had texted each other hundreds of romantic messages, BuzzFeed reported, and Woodrum told the court she was scammed by Cornelius and committed the crime “on the promise of a future together.” </p><p>But the judge disagreed that Woodrum, who lived near the Lake of the Ozarks, was “duped,” The Morning Herald reported.</p><p>“I do not accept that she is genuinely contrite for her offending as opposed to being sorry for the situation she now finds herself caught in,” Judge Penelope Wass said on Thursday. “She continues to blame others for her own reckless actions and appears to have little or no insight into her offending.” </p><p>Representatives for Australia’s Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions told The Washington Post that when Woodrum was in the airport, she said she was going to Sydney to see the Harbour Bridge and the aquarium. She also originally said the gold high-heeled shoes were a gift for her mom. </p><p>But once her suitcases were inspected, Woodrum allegedly said “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/08/14/a-devout-woman-thought-she-found-her-true-love-online-then-she-got-busted-for-cocaine-at-the-airport/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.356e62eac6bb\" target=\"_blank\">How much did they put in the shoes?</a> ... Sorry, just talking to myself,” according to the Post. </p><p>She then changed her story to say the shoes were a gift for her friend who she’d be meeting in the airport, the Post reported. </p><p>Woodrum was then arrested, police posted to Facebook last year.</p><p>“Besides the obvious crimes against fashion she was also charged with importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, namely cocaine,” the post said. “This charge comes with hefty prison terms and fines.” </p><p>The department joked that Dorothy from Wizard of Oz — with her sparkly red heels — knew what “Cinderella” did not. </p><p>“Even Dorothy knew to not try importing drugs into Oz,” the department said. </p><p> <!-- %asset:217915105% --> </p><p>It is unclear whether Woodrum’s “prince” is actually named Hendrik Cornelius or whether he is facing charges. </p><p>“The Commonwealth Director of Prosecutions is not an investigative agency and has no information on any investigation relating to ‘Hendrik Cornelius,’” the federal prosecutor’s office told The Post.</p><p>Woodrum’s dad, Tom Rozanski of Illinois, told the Post he didn’t believe the news about his daughter, who he says is a “good person.” </p><p>“When she gets out, she’s going to have to sit down and explain to me what she did and why she did it,” he told the newspaper. “If she knowingly went into this, it wasn’t fair for her to do what she did to her family.”</p><p>In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/article202830629.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Cocaine Cowgirls</a>” were also arrested after smuggling cocaine into Australia. The Canadian  women — and one alleged male accomplice — allegedly smuggled $30 million worth of cocaine into the country while on a cruise. </p><p>It was the “<a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadians-charged-australia-cocaine-1.3739299\" target=\"_blank\">largest seizure in Australia of narcotics</a> carried by passengers of a cruise ship or airliner,” CBC reported.</p><p> <!-- %asset:190503069% --> </p></div>",

              "summary": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>The 2018 Kansas City Chiefs will be exciting. They also might miss the playoffs for just the second time in six years, which is sort of the plan.</p></div>",
              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p class=\"p1\">The secret of the most anticipated Chiefs season in years is that this is not a Super Bowl contender, no matter <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/for-petes-sake/article217786245.html\" target=\"_blank\">what some in the national media are saying</a>.</p><p class=\"p1\">Might not even be a playoff team.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is not written to inflame or mock. This is not written simply because Eric Berry’s health remains uncertain, or the defense looked awful in the preseason. This is a sober look at a team with a first-year starting quarterback, major questions on defense and perhaps most convincingly a line of personnel moves that are subtly but consistently pointing to a more serious push beginning in 2019.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is not a hot take, in other words.</p><p class=\"p1\">This is the plan.</p><p class=\"p1\">Look at the biggest moves. Alex Smith was traded for a Kendall Fuller, a young and rising cornerback, and draft picks, the higher of which comes next year. This happened because the team wanted to build around young quarterback Patrick Mahomes, a tantalizing talent but one who so far has only torched Big 12 defenses at Texas Tech.</p><p class=\"p1\">Cornerback Marcus Peters was also traded, essentially because the organization was tired of repairing and reinforcing and worrying in his wake. Peters is young and game-changing and still cheap. You think a team that believes it’s close to a Super Bowl gives up on that?</p><p class=\"p1\">Of course not, but a team that believes it’s close to a Super Bowl will trade for that, which is why the Rams added him to one of the league’s most talented rosters.</p><p class=\"p1\">The free-agent moves were done with the future in mind, too. Sammy Watkins is just 25, and his red zone effectiveness (seven of his eight touchdowns last year were 17 yards or less) is seen as a complement to the 24-year-old Tyreek Hill (10 of his 13 career touchdown catches are 30 yards or more) to aid the development of the 22-year-old Mahomes.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217921400% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">Anthony Hitchens is just 26, a three-down linebacker the Chiefs think pairs well with Reggie Ragland inside and, more importantly, can be a pillar aside Justin Houston and Eric Berry to strengthen what football people refer to as “the culture.” That’s not a quick fix.</p><p class=\"p1\">You see the commonality here? Get younger, create stable support for a first-year starting quarterback and build a culture that will help rather than impede.</p><p class=\"p1\">The truth is the Chiefs’ defense probably had too many holes to fix all in one offseason, but certain circumstances also played against them.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Chiefs may have prioritized Bears cornerback Kyle Fuller in free agency, and if so it would have been on brand. He’s Kendall’s brother, another dependable teammate, and he would’ve strengthened a premium position.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">But after the Bears used their franchise tag on Fuller, the backup options were less enticing. Trumaine Johnson and Malcolm Butler each had varying so-called “character” questions, which would’ve been a difficult sell while talking about culture.</p><p class=\"p1\">Aaron Colvin would’ve been an upgrade, but the price — $34 million including $18 million guaranteed — was high for a player now listed as a backup on the Texans’ depth chart.</p><p class=\"p1\">So, the Chiefs spent bigger money on fewer players, with the caveat that the talent would still be in prime years in 2019 and 2020.</p><p class=\"p1\">The roster is full of “development guys,” particularly in the secondary — corners Charvarius Ward and Tremon Smith, safety Jordan Lucas and to a slightly lesser extent Armani Watts. The Chiefs will have an extra second-round pick next year, and will likely draft at least one cornerback high.</p><p class=\"p1\">If that’s the way it goes, the biggest concern going forward could be the pass rush. The Chiefs need as much as they can get from Houston as he enters his 30s, and more importantly they need some real production from a second rusher.</p><p class=\"p1\">Dee Ford is the most likely to make an impact in 2018, but he’s inconsistent, with unreliable health, can be a liability against the run, and will be a free agent after the season.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217768120% --> </p><p class=\"p1\">Rookie Breeland Speaks may be better suited inside — he played there in college, and could make an effective tandem with Chris Jones rushing in sub packages. If that’s the way it goes, the Chiefs would need some combination of retaining Ford, getting regular production from Tanoh Kpassagnoh, drafting a pass rusher high, or picking through a free agent class that could include Jadeveon Clowney.</p><p class=\"p1\">The other thing going on here is a tangible priority on the defensive front, perhaps influenced by the current Super Bowl champions.</p><p class=\"p1\">The discussion around the Eagles’ run typically centers around (Reid protege) Doug Pederson’s creativity, and that’s obviously a critical element.</p><p class=\"p1\">But the Eagles also won with a defense that ranked fourth in points, fourth in yards and second in Football Outsiders’ DVOA with a group of corners that nobody would envy. The strength of that group was up front, and with the safeties. The Chiefs could try to emulate.</p><p class=\"p1\">Either way, the Chiefs are approaching this as more than a quick fix. That may mean fewer wins in 2018. If that’s the way this goes, it won’t be a failure.</p><p class=\"p1\">It’ll be the plan.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217344510% --> </p></div>",

              "body": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>This isn’t a fantasy advice column. </p><p>So if you’ve clicked on this headline hoping for some guidance on who to sit and who to start in Week 1, you won’t find it here. In fact, you should probably do the opposite of whatever I do. </p><p>Instead, this is a (hopefully) weekly peek inside my all-girls fantasy football league.</p><p>In 2017, 59.3 million people played fantasy sports in the U.S. and Canada, according to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association. The largest chunk — 71 percent — were male, leaving women to make up the remaining 29 percent. </p><p>I’m happy to say that I’m one of the 29 percent, along with the nine other women in my league. </p><p>Founded by my friend Kelsey, we’ve been doing the all-girls league for four years now.</p><p>The league, “Run the World: GRILS” — yes, girls is misspelled, no we don’t know why we haven’t fixed it over the years — is pretty low-stakes. Some years we haven’t wagered any money. This year, we’re doing a $20 buy-in. </p><p>There are 10 players this year, and I only know four of them — Kelsey, Sarah, Erika and Taylor — in real life. The rest are connected through Kelsey and Sarah, whom I became friends with during a study abroad semester in college. </p><p> <!-- %asset:217921400% --> </p><p>The group is a diverse one. Six work in Washington, D.C., including Kelsey and Sarah, who work for Customs and Border Protection and the Justice Department’s public affairs office, respectively. </p><p>Another is a scheduler for a house member from California, one just finished her masters in International and European Politics at the University of Edinburgh and another works for an automotive product manufacturer in Ohio.</p><p>“I had played one season of fantasy previously with people from work which was majority men, so it was exciting that I would be playing with all women,” Erika wrote in our email chain. “I work for an automotive product manufacturer in Columbus (Ohio) which is a male dominated industry, so having an all-lady league is a refreshing opportunity to discuss football with someone other than a middle aged father of three.” </p><p>Preach, girl. </p><p>We have Steelers fans, Giants fans, Patriots fans, Browns fans and fans of watching football with friends on Sunday afternoons. </p><p>And of course, we have me. You’d think a football writer would have an unfair advantage in a fantasy football league. </p><p>You’d also be wrong. </p><p>To be clear, I’m not bad because I don’t understand how it works. I’m bad because I’m a big softy. I draft guys who I’ve covered and ones who I have a genuine interest in following off the field. It mimics my approach for telling stories on the beats I cover, which works great for reporting and not so much for competitive fantasy football leagues. <br/><br/></p><p>Last year Erika — team name Gurley Show — won the league, and Sarah came in second. Laura, known this year as Gronk A Donk, was third. Honestly, I have no idea where I finished, but I know that I didn’t win any money. Based on the fact that I had the third pick this year, I’m guessing I was somewhere toward the bottom. <br/><br/></p><p>With my drafting habits, I know that’s shocking. </p><p>I know some fantasy leagues have elaborate draft ceremonies and make an event out of it. That’s not what we did. Kelsey, the commissioner, sent out an email Sunday night to schedule it. We exchanged emails in a thread through Monday afternoon and hastily decided that Monday night worked best for all of us. </p><p>Because Sarah was catching a flight and others had other fantasy drafts, Kelsey gave us 30 seconds per pick. </p><p>Talk about stress. </p><p>I can’t pick out what scented candle I want at Target in 30 seconds, much less decide on which players will help me to a yet another mediocre finish. </p><p>My team — Post Mahomes — started out on a strong note, picking up Todd Gurley with my first selection. As a fellow North Carolinian, Gurley fits my rule of drafting guys I have some kind of connection to. </p><p>In between rounds, I tried to FaceTime my fiancé for some advice, but things were moving so quickly that I got stressed and ended the call before he could really help. Big mistake. </p><p>He did advise me to draft Christian McCaffrey, which I did. I briefly covered McCaffrey’s brother, Max, at Duke, so it still adheres to my draft method. </p><p>In the next round, I finally put my NFL knowledge to use. I was torn between drafting Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, but ultimately went with Kelce because I think he’ll get more targets than Hill based on the preseason. </p><p>Then I started to panic in the 30-second windows.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">I drafted both </span>Demaryius Thomas<em> </em>and Emmanuel Sanders in back-to-back rounds. I don’t have a good explanation for it, either. I was about to autodraft a defense out of my cue in the seventh round, and I saw Sanders’ name on the list of top available players, so I just pulled the trigger with a second left. Their Bye Week is going to be painful. </p><p>It turns out I wasn’t the only one who panicked under pressure. </p><p>Taylor drafted three defenses and three quarterbacks, and Kelsey forgot to draft a backup quarterback. </p><p>I feel good about my starting lineup — Deshaun Watson, Gurley, McCaffrey, Thomas, Jarvis Landry, Kelce, Sanders, Bears defense and Sebastian Janikowski. My bench is almost entirely players from OU, UNC or North Carolina: Adrian Peterson, Sterling Shepard, Tarik Cohen, Kenny Stills, Gio Bernard and Mitch Trubisky. Calvin Ridley rounds out the bench as the only non-NC or OU tie. </p><p>This week, I’m opening up the season against Kelsey (team name: Captain Kirk And The Giants). She’s ultra-competitive, so I’m already preparing to get my butt kicked. She’s starting Phillip Rivers — bolo tie and all — against KC’s secondary, so I like her chances even more. </p></div>",

But that’s exactly what the oddsmakers in Vegas must do anyway.</p><p>And they envision the Chiefs taking a step backwards, albeit a small one.</p><p>After three consecutive double-digit win seasons, Vegas has placed the Chiefs’ regular season over-under for wins at 8 1/2, according to Bovada. They need nine victories, in other words, to make the over wager a winning ticket.</p><p>The oddsmakers don’t like the Chiefs’ chances to repeat as the AFC West champions either. The Los Angeles Chargers are listed as the favorite to win the division, followed by the Chiefs.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217586570% --> </p><p>Kansas City’s odds to win the Super Bowl are 25-to-1, which falls into the middle of the pack in the NFL. The Patriots are the favorite at 5-to-1, with the Eagles and Rams both 8-to-1.</p><p>What do the odds suggest about the statistical seasons the individual players might produce?</p><p>Let’s start with Mahomes. They have the over/under lines listed at 3,750 yards, 23 touchdowns and 13 1/2 interceptions. Only four players have higher interception totals. But the ceiling on Mahomes remains relatively high. He’s listed at 60-to-1 to win the league’s most valuable player award, tied for the 20th best odds in the NFL. For comparison’s sake, Alex Smith had 4,042 yards, 26 touchdowns and five interceptions in 2017.</p><p>Running back Kareem Hunt led the league in rushing as a rookie last season, finishing with 1,327 yards, eight rushing touchdowns. His 2018 projections in Vegas are 1,150 rushing yards and 10 1/2 rushing touchdowns, per Bovada. Ten players have better odds to win the rushing title than Hunt, even though he holds the belt.</p><p>The forecast for tight end Travis Kelce and wide receiver Tyreek Hill are quite similar. Each has their over/under for receiving yards listed at an even 1,000. Hill’s over/under for total touchdowns — receiving, rushing and returning combined — are seven. Kelce’s receiving touchdowns are listed at six. Hill had 1,183 yards and eight total touchdowns in 2017. Kelce had 1,038 yards and eight touchdowns.</p><p>So why do the sports betting oddsmakers set Kelce and Hill with slightly worse outputs this year? A couple of factors are at play. First, they don’t believe Mahomes will repeat the season Smith had last year. And second, there is another player to split the touches with.</p><p>Incoming wide receiver Sammy Watkins’ over/under for yards and touchdowns in his first season in Kansas City are 800 and 5 1/2, respectively. Those are much higher numbers than the Chiefs got from their No. 2 wide receiver a year ago. While Watkins caught eight scores last season, the yardage would be a significant bump in his production. Watkins had only 593 yards in 2017 with the Rams and just 430 yards in an injury-ravaged season in 2016. An injury, of course, would not negate the wager.</p><p>On the defensive side, linebacker Justin Houston is calculated for eight sacks. Houston has proved one of the most difficult players for Vegas to set lines, given his injury history. He had 9 1/2 sacks in 2017 but only four in 2016 and just 7 1/2 in 2015.</p><p>In their opener, the Chiefs are a 3 1/2-point underdog against the Chargers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> <br/><br/></span></p><p> <!-- %asset:217344670% --> </p></div>",

Conrad, offensive lineman George Asafo-Adjei, running back Benny Snell, outside linebacker Josh Allen and safety Mike Edwards.</p><p class=\"p2\">“Just hearing the crowd and I was like, ‘This is real. Let’s get after it,’” Daniel said smiling after Wednesday night’s practice.</p><p class=\"p2\">Get after it he did. The 6-foot-1, 242-pound junior from Paintsville presently leads the Southeastern Conference in tackles with 11 and two quarterback hurries. His 11 tackles were four more than he recorded all of last season.</p><p><!-- %asset:217922175; alt=\"undefined\" align=\"center\"% --></p><p class=\"p2\">“He didn’t stick out like a first-time starter,” Coach Mark Stoops said of Daniel, who had played mostly on special teams in his previous two seasons.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p class=\"p2\">“I haven’t looked at him that way because he’s been playing like that all spring, all camp. Really didn’t look at him as a first-time starter until you pointed that out to me right there. Because he’s just a guy that’s been around, been in our system and working hard.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p class=\"p2\"> <!-- %asset:217724580% --> <br/><br/></p><p class=\"p2\">There’s still plenty that Daniel can improve, both the linebacker and his position coach said this week. Defensive coordinator Matt House pointed to one play where if Daniel had dipped his shoulders, he would’ve had a tackle for loss, but Central Michigan got 3 yards on a run play instead.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>“Those are the plays, in order to be successful, you’ve got to make because it puts them in third-and-long instead of third-and-medium, which is huge,” House said.</p><p class=\"p2\">But House was pleased with what he saw overall from the inside linebacker spots.</p><p class=\"p2\">Getting the victory and being the team’s leading tackler were special, but being named a captain after a vote by his teammates made it extra special for Daniel on Saturday.</p><p class=\"p2\">That’s the dream no matter where a player is born or what team he grew up rooting for.</p><p class=\"p2\">“I’m forever thankful that my teammates think that highly of me,” Daniel said. “Every day I come in, my first goal is to try to be the best teammate I can possibly be. No matter if it’s in the locker room, on the field or off the field, these dudes are my brothers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p class=\"p2\">“For them to think of me as a captain as a junior going forward, I couldn’t be awarded a higher honor than that.”</p><h3>Saturday</h3><p class=\"p2\"><b>Kentucky at No. 25 Florida</b></p><p class=\"p2\"><b>When: </b>7:30 p.m.</p><p class=\"p2\"><b>TV:</b> SEC Network</p></div>",

After Florida, according to the FPI, Kentucky can only reasonably be expected to win three games on the rest of its schedule — Murray State (99 percent), Vanderbilt (65 percent) and Middle Tennessee (82.3 percent).</p><p><!-- %asset:217761150% --> </p><p>Kentucky’s chances against the rest of the schedule, according to the FPI:</p><ul><li>No. 18 Mississippi State — 18.6 percent. The Cats get the Bulldogs at home this year, where it snapped a seven-game losing streak to MSU in 2016.<br/><br/></li><li>No. 24 South Carolina — 30.9 percent. UK has won four straight in this series, but last year’s Gamecocks got rolling after facing the Cats and defeated Michigan in the Outback Bowl.<br/><br/></li><li>Texas A&amp;M — 12.3 percent. The Aggies remain unranked, but the FPI has Jimbo Fisher’s new squad at No. 15 in its index. With the game at College Station, this might not be far off.<br/><br/></li><li>Missouri — 18.6 percent. Kentucky has won the last three meetings with Missouri, but, perhaps, the combination of this game being held in Columbia and the Tigers’ dynamic offense combines to set this game at one of UK’s poorest chances.<br/><br/></li><li>No. 3 Georgia — 10.5 percent. Beating the reigning SEC champs at Kroger Field would be one for the record books.<br/><br/></li><li>Tennessee — 44.8 percent. UK gets its second-best SEC chance of the season on the road in Knoxville.<br/><br/></li><li>Louisville — 34.1 percent. Louisville only ranks marginally better in the FPI (No. 52) than Kentucky, but gets more credit for playing at home, apparently.<br/><br/></li></ul><p>Some of the more distressing numbers, according to FPI for UK:</p><ul><li>The Cats have 0 percent chance to go undefeated.<br/><br/></li><li>They have 0 percent chance to win the SEC.<br/><br/></li><li>UK’s strength of schedule has an average FPI ranking of 35 for the rest of the season.<br/><br/></li><li>Its average win probability is 66.2 percent.</li><li>Its projected win/loss record is 5.3-6.7, which would mean no bowl game for the Cats.</li></ul><p> <!-- %asset:217851605% --> </p></div>",
